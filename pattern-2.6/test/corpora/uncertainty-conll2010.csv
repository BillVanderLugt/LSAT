"1","Prelingual deafness"
"-1","In children, this type of hearing loss can lead to social isolation for several reasons."
"1","This can result in a deaf person becoming generally irritable."
"-1","A child who uses sign language, or identifies with the Deaf culture does not generally experience this isolation, particularly if he/she attends a school for the deaf, but may conversely experience isolation from his parents if they do not know, or make an effort to learn sign language."
"1","A child who is exclusively or predominantly oral (using speech for communication) can experience social isolation from his or her hearing peers, particularly if no one takes the time to explicitly teach them social skills that other children acquire independently by virtue of having normal hearing."
"1","Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot"
"1","Instead of writing in terms of general ideas, d'Alembert provides the dates, places and people responsible for the progress of literary works since the Renaissance leading up to his date."
"1","Noted in the text is the lack of improvement in philosophy in comparison to other advancements due to the ignorant belief that ancient philosophy could not be questioned."
"1","d'Alembert claims that it would be ignorant to perceive that everything could be known about a particular subject."
"1","He makes clear that all sciences are restricted as much as can be to facts and that opinion influences science as little as possible."
"1","d'Alembert states that philosophy is far more effective at the analysis of our perceptions when the &quot;soul is in a state of tranquility&quot;, when it is not caught up in passion and emotion (96)."
"1","Furthermore, the importance of science and the advancements of such intellects as Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Descartes, John Locke and others are explained."
"1","Prejudice"
"1","Historically, psychologists suggested various personalities contributing to discrimination, including authoritarianism, dogmatism, closed-mindedness, dominant orientation, etc (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950; Rokeach, 1948; Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, &amp; Malle, 1994)."
"1","In general, people having these personalities tend to bias towards their own group and refuse to accept belief-contradicting information, thus remain their stereotype on the prejudiced group."
"-1","However, as the overemphasis on parental influence of psychodynamics theory has been strongly criticized in the previous century, modern psychologists adopted interracial contact as a more important determinant than childhood experience on shaping people’s prejudice traits (Stephan &amp; Rosenfield, 1978)."
"-1","Personality theory has also been criticized on underemphasizing situational and socio-cultural factors such as the competition of resources between groups, and being unable to explain sudden change in attitude and behaviour."
"-1","this can also be summarized as a distinguish behaviour on the peronnel level"
"1","Preiddeu Annwfn"
"1","In the Irish tale, the Milesians, the ancestors to the Irish people, encounter a glass tower in the middle of the ocean whose inhabitants do not speak with them."
"1","The Milesians attack, and like Arthur's expedition, lose most of their force."
"1","Loomis further suggests that this story is connected to the Abduction of Guinevere episode common in later literature."
"1","Sarah Higley suggests a common story that influenced these various Welsh and Irish accounts."
"1","Prehistoric music"
"-1","Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring sounds and rhythms."
"-1","Human music may echo these phenomena using patterns, repetition and tonality."
"-1","Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their music intending to imitate natural sounds."
"-1","In some instances, this feature is related to shamanistic beliefs or practice."
"-1","It may also serve entertainment (game)Nattiez: 5 or practical (luring animals in hunt) functions."
"1","Prehistoric medicine"
"-1","Plant materials (herbs and substances derived from natural sources),Use of Spices for Medical Purposes] Mentions spices being used by some prehistoric cultures were among the treatments for diseases in prehistoric cultures."
"-1","Since plant materials quickly rot under most conditions, historians are unlikely to fully understand which species were used in prehistoric medicine."
"1","An idea can be obtained by looking at the climate of the respective society and which species continue to grow there today and through anthropological studies of existing indigenous peoples."
"-1","Unlike the ancient civilisations which could source plant materials internationally, prehistoric societies would have been restricted to localised areas, though nomadic tribes may have had a greater variety of plant materials at their disposal than more stationary societies."
"1","Prehistoric medicine"
"-1","Earths and clays may have provided prehistoric peoples with some of their first medicines."
"-1","This is related to geophagy, which is extremely widespread among animals in the wild as well as among domesticated animals."
"1","In particular, geophagy is widespread among contemporary nonhuman primates."
"-1","Also, early humans could have learned about the use of various healing clays by observing animal behavior."
"1","Prehistoric art"
"-1","Relatively little is known about the early settlement of much of South America east of the Andes."
"1","This is due to the lack of stone (generally required for leaving durable artifacts), and a jungle environment that rapidly recycles organic materials."
"-1","Beyond the Andean regions, where the inhabitants were more clearly related to the early cultures of Peru, early finds are generally limited to coastal areas and those areas where there are stone outcrops."
"-1","While there is evidence of human habitation in northern Brazil as early as 8000BCE and rock art of unknown (or at best uncertain) age, ceramics appear to be the earliest artistic artifacts."
"1","Prehistoric art"
"1","Megalithic monuments are found in the Neolithic from Malta to Portugal, through France, and across southern England to most of Wales and Ireland They are also found in northern Germany and Poland, as well as in Egypt in the Sahara desert (at Nabata and other sites)."
"1","The best preserved of all temples and the oldest free standing structures on Earth are the Megalithic Temples of Malta."
"-1","They start in the 5th millennium BC, though some authors speculate on Mesolithic roots."
"1","There are many sites for rock and cave art of engraved animal and human scenes in the Saharan area."
"-1","While the best-known of these is Stonehenge, where the main structures date from the early Bronze Age, such monuments have been found throughout most of Western and Northern Europe, notably at Carnac, France, at Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands, in Portugal, and in Wiltshire, England, the area of Stonehenge, the Avebury circle, the tombs at West Kennet, and Woodhenge."
"-1","The tomb of Knowth has rock-cut ornaments as well; one of them may be the oldest known image of the Moon."
"-1","Many of these monuments were megalithic tombs, and archaeologists speculate that most have religious significance."
"1","Knowth is reputed to have approximately one third of all megalithic art in Western Europe."
"1","Prehistoric Norfolk"
"1","In total, some 2,079 bones, tusks, antlers and teeth of Mammuthus primigenius (mammoth), Coelodonta antiquitatis(woolly rhinoceros), Rangifer tarandus (reindeer), Equus ferus (horse), Bison priscus (bison), Canis lupus (wolf), Vulpes vulpes or Alopex lagopus (red or Arctic fox) and Ursus arctos (brown bear) were individually recorded and a further 25,000 bone, tooth and tusk fragments recovered."
"1","Feces of scavengers (possibly the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta) were also recovered from the organic sediments."
"1","The bone varied in condition with some bones extensively weathered and others exhibiting traces of gnawing by predator-scavengers."
"1","Bone fractures characteristic of marrow extraction by hominids have been identified on the some of the reindeer and horse bones recovered from the deposit."
"1","Prehistoric Ireland"
"1","Settlements of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers have been found at about half a dozen sites scattered throughout the country: Mount Sandel in County Londonderry (Coleraine); Woodpark in County Sligo; the Shannon estuary; Lough Boora in County Offaly; the Curran in County Antrim; and a number of locations in Munster."
"-1","Although sea levels were still lower than they are today, Ireland may already have been an island by the time the first settlers arrived by boat."
"-1","There is nothing surprising in this, though, for most of the Mesolithic sites in Ireland are coastal settlements."
"-1","In some ways this economy was forced upon them, for many centuries were to pass before the treeless permafrost was transformed into a densely forested fertile land."
"1","Pregnancy category"
"1","Australia has a slightly different pregnancy category system from the United States - notably the subdivision of Category B."
"1","The system, as outlined below, was established by the Congenital Abnormalities Sub-committee of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC)."
"1","ADEC Pregnancy Categories (Australia)"
"1","'Pregnancy Category A'"
"1","Drugs which have been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed."
"1","'Pregnancy Category B1'"
"1","Drugs which have been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed."
"-1","Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage."
"1","'Pregnancy Category B2'"
"1","Drugs which have been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed."
"-1","Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage."
"1","'Pregnancy Category B3'"
"1","Drugs which have been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed."
"-1","Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans."
"1","'Pregnancy Category C"
"-1","'Drugs which, owing to their pharmaceutical effects, have caused or may be suspected of causing, harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations."
"-1","These effects may be reversible."
"1","'Pregnancy Category D'"
"-1","Drugs which have caused, are suspected to have caused or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage."
"-1","These drugs may also have adverse pharmacological effects.'"
"1","Pregnancy"
"1","Traditionally, doctors have measured pregnancy from a number of convenient points, including the day of last menstruation, ovulation, fertilization, implantation and chemical detection."
"1","In medicine, pregnancy is often defined as beginning when the developing embryo becomes implanted into the endometrial lining of a woman's uterus."
"-1","In some cases where complications may have arisen, the fertilized egg might implant itself in the fallopian tubes or the cervix, causing an ectopic pregnancy."
"1","This is usually of no concern unless there is spotting or bleeding as well."
"1","Preference regression (in marketing)"
"1","It usually supplements product positioning techniques like multi dimensional scaling or factor analysis and is used to create ideal vectors on perceptual maps."
"1","'Perceptual Map of Competing Products with Ideal Vectors'"
"-1","Starting with raw data from surveys, researchers apply positioning techniques to determine important dimensions and plot the position of competing products on these dimensions."
"1","Like all regression methods, the computer fits weights to best predict data."
"1","The resultant regression line is referred to as an ideal vector because the slope of the vector is the ratio of the preferences for the two dimensions."
"1","Prefecture Apostolic of Kwang-si"
"-1","The Chinese authorities placed many obstacles in the way of the free spread of the Gospel."
"-1","Fathers Lavest and Pernet were subjected to cruel treatment and several Christian communities were uprooted."
"-1","Under the direction of the new prefect, other communities were established, and finally a certain measure of liberty was accorded to the missionaries."
"1","During the Boxer troubles but three missions and a few other houses belonging to the Christians were pillaged."
"1","Prefab Sprout"
"1","Though the music was more accessible than their earlier material, the lyrics and subject matter remained characteristically oblique and suggestive (McAloon has often cited Stephen Sondheim as an influence)."
"-1","In addition to its religious overtones, perhaps reflecting McAloon's education in a Catholic seminary, there were several allegorical songs about a character who embodied a mix of Howard Hughes, Jesse James, and Elvis Presley."
"-1","McAloon has alluded in interviews to several albums-worth of songs that he has written but are unreleased/unrecorded including amongst others, concept albums based on the life of Michael Jackson ('Behind the Veil'), the history of the world ('Earth: The Story So Far') and ('Zorro the Fox') about a fictional superhero."
"1","Their greatest hits, 'The Best of - A Life of Surprises', gave them their biggest U.S. hit, &quot;If You Don't Love Me&quot;, which spent several weeks in the Top 10 on the dance chart."
"1","Preemptive Strike (Star Trek: The Next Generation)"
"-1","After verifying her cover story, they quickly accept her into their ranks, although several of their number are concerned she may be a Federation spy and do not trust her."
"1","She immediately forms a bond with Macias, an elderly and paternal Bajoran who is the leader of the Maquis cell, who Ro obviously sees as a father figure."
"1","Soon after Ro joins the militants they hear rumors that the Cardassians are planning on arming their citizens in the zone with deadly Biogenic weapons."
"1","Ro offers to steal the needed supplies from the 'Enterprise', however, another Maquis, mistrustful of Ro and planning to monitor her, 'volunteers' to tag along."
"1","Predispositioning Theory"
"1","Since it is impossible to devise a deterministic chain linking the inter-mediate state with the outcome of the game, the most complex component of any indeterministic method is assessing these intermediate stages."
"1","It is precisely the function of predispositions to assess the impact of an intermediate state upon the future course of development.”"
"1","According to Katsenelinboigen, calculus of predispositions is another method of computing probability."
"-1","Both methods may lead to the same results and, thus, can be interchangeable."
"-1","However, it is not always possible to interchange them since computing via frequencies requires availability of statistics, possibility to gather the data as well as having the knowledge of the extent to which one can interlink the system’s constituent elements."
"1","Predictive analytics"
"-1","Multivariate regression (above) is generally used when the response variable is continuous and has an unbounded range."
"-1","Often the response variable may not be continuous but rather discrete."
"-1","While mathematically it is feasible to apply multivariate regression to discrete ordered dependent variables, some of the assumptions behind the theory of multivariate linear regression no longer hold, and there are other techniques such as discrete choice models which are better suited for this type of analysis."
"1","If the dependent variable is discrete, some of those superior methods are logistic regression, multinomial logit and probit models."
"1","Predictions of Soviet collapse"
"1","The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people."
"1","…Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction."
"1","The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people."
"1","…What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people."
"1","Predictions of Soviet collapse"
"-1","&quot;Given these judgments of the Soviet future made by political leaders and journalists, the question is why were they right and so many of our Sovietological colleagues wrong."
"1","Reagan and Levin came from rightist backgrounds, and Moynihan, much like the leaders of the AFL-CIO, from a leftist anti-Stalinist social-democratic milieu, environments that disposed participants to believe the worst."
"-1","Most of the Sovietologists, on the other hand, were left-liberal in their politics, an orientation that undermined their capacity to accept the view that economic statism, planning, socialist incentives, would not work."
"1","They were also for the most part ignorant of, or ignored, the basic Marxist formulation that it is impossible to build socialism in impoverished societies.&quot;"
"1","Predicted effects of the FairTax"
"1","Proponents believe environmental benefits would result both indirectly and directly from implementation of the FairTax."
"-1","The concepts of environmental economics come into play with some of the aspects suggested."
"-1","With the subsequent increase of the used-goods market (and with new goods being taxed) it is suspected that people would put more emphasis on maintenance of things for longer use and better resale value, and that they may also shy away from disposable goods."
"-1","This may reduce international shipping and consequent environmental impact, as well as production in countries with less stringent pollution controls."
"1","Predicta"
"1","To properly restore a Predicta (as well as other Philco sets of the era), the PC board must be removed from the chassis."
"-1","They did the same with several other lines."
"-1","Certain controls were known for failure."
"1","In most cases, Sams Photofacts gives the equivalent circuit."
"1","Predestination"
"-1","Some critics claim that the idea that God is omnipotent and omniscient didn't formally exist in Judaism during the Biblical era, but rather was a later development due to the influence of neo-Platonic and neo-Aristotelian philosophy."
"-1","Many modern Jewish thinkers in the 20th century have resolved the dialectical tension by holding that God is simply not omnipotent, in the commonly used sense of that word."
"-1","Orthodox Jewish rabbis generally affirm that God must be viewed as omnipotent, but they have varying definitions of what the word 'omnipotent' means."
"-1","Thus one finds that some Modern Orthodox theologians have views that are essentially the same as non-Orthodox theologians, but they use different terminology."
"1","Predatory pricing"
"-1","Predatory pricing practices may result in antitrust claims of monopolization or attempts to monopolize."
"1","Businesses with dominant or substantial market shares are more vulnerable to antitrust claims."
"1","However, because the antitrust laws are ultimately intended to benefit consumers, and discounting results in at least short-term net benefit to consumers, the U.S. Supreme Court has set high hurdles to antitrust claims based on a predatory pricing theory."
"-1","If there is a likelihood that market entrants will prevent the predator from recouping its investment through supra competitive pricing, then there is no probability of success and the antitrust claim would fail."
"1","Predator (alien)"
"1","In the 'Aliens vs. Predator' novel series based on the Dark Horse Comics by David Bischoff, Steve and Stephani Perry, the Predators, known in the series as &quot;Yautja&quot;, are depicted as living in a matriarchal clan-based society bearing similarities to a pack mentality, with the stronger and most skilled of the group being leader."
"-1","Assuming the warrior was armed and expert, it might almost be an even match, but Dachande would put his wager on the female."
"1","His most recent partner had tossed him across a room during the heat of their mating and that had been an accident...&quot;'"
"1","'&quot;Yautja females are bigger than males ... it also explained why this warrior was smarter than most of the Yautja he taught. &quot;', Steve &amp; Stephanie Perry and sporting more prominent mammary glands (like human females)."
"1","This musk can be detected by other Predators and canids, though it is imperceptible to humans."
"1","Predation"
"-1","Social predation allows some animals to organize hunts of creatures that would easily escape a single predator; thus chimpanzees can prey upon colubus monkeys, and harrier hawks can cut off all possible escapes for a doomed rabbit."
"-1","Extreme specialization of roles is evident in some hunting that requires co-operation between predators of very different species: humans with the aid of falcons or dogs, or fishing with cormorants or dogs."
"1","Social predation is often very complex behavior, and not all social creatures (for example, domestic cats) perform it."
"-1","Even without complex intelligence but instinct alone, some ant species can destroy much-larger creatures."
"1","Predation"
"-1","It has been observed that well-fed predator animals in a lax captivity (for instance, pet or farm animals) will usually differentiate between putative prey animals who are familiar co-inhabitants in the same human area from wild ones outside the area."
"-1","This interaction can range from peaceful coexistence to close companionship; motivation to ignore the predatory instinct may result from mutual advantage or fear of reprisal from human masters who have made clear that harming co-inhabitants will not be tolerated."
"-1","Pet cats and pet mice, for example, may live together in the same human residence without incident as companions."
"1","Pet cats and pet dogs under human mastership often depend on each other for warmth, companionship, and even protection, particularly in rural areas."
"1","Precursors of film"
"1","Shadow shows are known from the earliest recorded times, and the principle that an image is visually retained for a short time after observation has ceased was observed in ancient times."
"1","c. 3200 BC - An earthen bowl found in Shahr-i Sokhta, Iran, has five images of a goat painted along the sides."
"-1","This is believed to be an example of early animation.."
"1","His lamp experiment, where several different light sources are arranged across a large area, is the first successful projection of an entire image from outdoors onto a screen indoors with the 'camera obscura'."
"1","1515 - Leonardo da Vinci describes a structure that would produce this effect."
"1","1544 - Reinerus Gemma-Frisius, a Dutch scientist, illustrates large rooms built for the purpose of viewing eclipses by this means."
"1","1588 - Giovanni Battista Della Porta tips off artists to this trick."
"1","1610 - Johannes Kepler refers to a construction that utilises this phenomenon as a 'camera obscura'."
"1","c. 1610 - Della Porta perfected the camera obscura using a convex lens."
"1","1671 - Athanasius Kircher projects images painted on glass plates with an oil lamp and a lens, his 'Magic Lantern'."
"1","1724 - Johann Heinrich Schulze discovers that certain silver salts, most notably silver chloride and silver nitrate, darken in the presence of light."
"-1","The article is often incorrectly cited as 'Persistence of Vision with Regard to Moving Objects', or 'On the Persistence of Vision with Regard to Human Motion', and given an incorrect date."
"1","1824/1827 - Nicéphore Niépce produces a permanent image on a bitumen-coated pewter plate exposed for eight hours."
"1","1826 - John Ayrton Paris markets the 'Thaumatrope', a card which, when spun, gives the illusion of movement."
"1","1831 - Faraday's Law of electromagnetic."
"1","Precision Drilling"
"1","Precision incorporates"
"1","Precision becomes the majority shareholder in United Diamond Ltd., which designs, manufactures, rents and sells polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) drill bits."
"1","Precision also receives an exclusive, worldwide license to Georservices' EM-MWD technology, using it extensively with the Computalog subsidiary."
"1","2001 Computalog U.S.A., Inc. acquires all shares of Premium Pump Services Inc., which provides pressure-pumping services like cementing, fracturing and other stimulation services."
"1","Precision Drilling Corporation announces it has successfully operated its HEL MWD and PrecisionLWD tools."
"1","2005 Precision Drilling Corporation sells its Energy Services and International Drilling divisions to Weatherford International Ltd. for 26,000,000 common shares of Weatherford and $1 CAD."
"1","Precision Drilling Corporation announces the sale of CEDA International Corporation for a price of approximately $274 million CAD."
"1","Precision Castparts Corp."
"1","The company manufactures a variety of parts for the aerospace industry including many jet engine components."
"1","PCC also makes medical prostheses and parts for other industrial applications such as in the oil industry, the gas industry, and for use in power generating turbines for producing electricity."
"1","They are considered a leader in the manufacturing of both jet engine airfoils and gas turbines used for generating electricity."
"1","Other products made from the various metals are fasteners, products for the paper industry, parts used in the defense industry, and parts forthe automotive industry."
"1","Precinct"
"-1","A precinct is generally the lowest-level governmentally-related division in the United States, and in that context is also known in some places as an 'election district'."
"1","Precincts usually do not have separate governmental authorities, but for purposes of conducting elections, an entity such as a county or township is typically subdivided into precincts and each address is assigned to a specific precinct."
"1","Sometimes several precincts will use the same polling station."
"1","A 2004 survey by the United States Election Assistance Commission reported an average precinct size in the United States of approximately 1,100 registered voters."
"1","Preces"
"1","R. Intercede for your children so that, being faithful to the spirit of Opus Dei, we may sanctify our work, and win souls for Christ."
"1","R. That all may be one, as you, Father, and I are one; that they may be one, as we are one."
"1","Enkindle, O Lord, our hearts and minds with the fire of the Holy Spirit, that we may serve you with a chaste body and please you with a clean heart."
"1","Direct, we beseech you, Lord, our actions by your inspirations, and further them by your assistance, so that every word and work of ours may begin always from you and by you be likewise ended."
"1","Precentor"
"-1","A 'precentor' is a person, usually a clergy member, who is in charge of preparing worship services."
"-1","This position is usually held in a large church, and is typically used in the churches of the Anglican Communion."
"-1","The precentor of a cathedral is usually a residentiary canon or prebendary, and may be assisted by a succentor (particularly in the daily task of leading choral singing)."
"-1","In some cathedrals (including Canterbury), the Precentor is a minor Canon, and therefore part of the Foundation, but not part of the Chapter."
"1","Prebiotic (nutrition)"
"1","Studies have demonstrated positive effects on calcium and other mineral absorption and intestinal regularity."
"-1","Recent human trials have reinforced the role of Prebiotics in preventing and possibly stopping early stage colon cancer."
"-1","It has been argued that many of these health effects emanate not just from bifidogenic function of prebiotics, but also from increased production of short-chain fatty acids by the stimulated beneficial bacteria."
"1","While research does clearly demonstrate that prebiotics lead to increased production of these SCFA, more research is required to establish a direct causal connection."
"1","Preamble to the United States Constitution"
"1","(&quot;The Constitution was created by the people of the 'United States', as a union of 'states', to be governed solely by representatives of the 'states'.&quot;); (&quot;By the constitution a government is ordained and established ‘for the United States of America,’ and not for countries outside of their limits."
"1","The guaranties it affords against accusation of capital or infamous crimes, except by indictment or presentment by a grand jury, and for an impartial trial by a jury when thus accused, apply only to citizens and others within the United States, or who are brought there for trial for alleged offenses committed elsewhere, and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad.&quot;)."
"1","(&quot;The petitioner does not claim that he was not afforded a fair trial aside from the denial of his demand for a jury."
"1","Inasmuch as unquestionably he obtained a trial more to his liking than he would have obtained in Shanghai in other than an American court sitting in Shanghai, and since the Supreme Court of this country has determined that the right of trial by jury does not obtain in an American court sitting in another country pursuant to treaty, it must be held that the allegations of petitioner's petition do not entitle him to release.&quot;)."
"1","Pre-sectarian Buddhism"
"-1","The term 'pre-sectarian Buddhism' is used by some scholars for example: '... stressed that the written canon in Buddhism is sectarian from the outset, and that presectarian Buddhism must be deduced from the writings as they now exist).'"
"-1","This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period &quot;before the schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC."
"1","It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself."
"1","Pre-election day events of the Singapore general election, 2006"
"1","Lee highlighted the successes of the PAP government since the last election, especially in creating jobs, reducing unemployment, retraining workers, and investing in young people."
"1","He argued that the strategies were working and economy was striving, and that PAP had united the people under the threat of terrorism."
"-1","He reminded viewers that Singapore would have great opportunities as well as major challenges ahead as Asia was rising, and the PAP would make Singapore a land of opportunity for all people, and each person could find his or her own niche and excel."
"1","He said that the government would educate each Singaporean to be the best they can be."
"1","Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan"
"-1","It is not yet clear, however, to what extent these periods were contemporaneous with similar stages of development in other geographic regions."
"-1","Urban civilization, which includes most of Iran, Afghanistan, North Western Province of Pakistan which are Pashtoons, may have begun as early as 3000 to 2000 BCE (see also Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex and Indus Valley Civilization)."
"-1","The ancient city of Mudigak may have been a provincial colony of the Indus Valley Civilization or closely affiliated, but this remains largely circumstantial and speculative."
"1","Archaeological finds also indicate the possible beginnings of the Bronze Age which would ultimately spread throughout the ancient world from Afghanistan."
"1","Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact"
"1","Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés records several such legends in his 'General y natural historia de las Indias' of 1526, which includes biographical information on Columbus."
"1","The crew gathered supplies and made its way back to Europe, but the trip took several months and the captain and most of the men died before reaching land."
"1","The ship's pilot, a man from somewhere in the Iberian peninsula (Oviedo says different versions have him as Portuguese, Basque, or Andalusian), and very few others finally made it to Portugal, but all were very ill."
"1","People in Oviedo's time knew this story in several versions, but Oviedo regarded it as myth."
"1","Pre-Columbian"
"1","By the first millennium, South America’s vast rainforests, mountains, plains, and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people."
"-1","Some groups formed permanent settlements."
"1","Among those groups were the Chibchas (or &quot;Muiscas&quot; or &quot;Muyscas&quot;), Valdivia and the Tairona."
"1","The Chibchas of Colombia, Valdivia of Ecuador, the Quechuas of Peru, and the Aymara of Bolivia were the four most important sedentary Amerindian groups in South America."
"1","Prayer (song)"
"1","Because of the subject matter...we needed something grandiose like an earthquake or a meteor shower or some kind of act of God to show the hand of the supernatural or some greater power.&quot;"
"1","Draiman said, &quot;[The video is] about getting through life's obstacles and all the tests that fate may throw at you in the process."
"1","It's trying to convince you that you have the strength to get through whatever trials and tribulations may come your way."
"-1","Despite &quot;Prayer&quot; receiving little airplay, Disturbed continued to promote the music video by including it on their album, 'Believe', and by posting it on various websites."
"1","Prayer"
"-1","Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality (the &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; in Biblical terms) into clearer focus in the human scene."
"1","The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas."
"-1","Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality."
"-1","Christian Scientists do not practice intercessory prayer as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other."
"1","(However, the choice of healing method is regarded as a matter for the individual, and the Christian Science Church exerts no pressure on members to avoid medical treatment if they wish to avail of it as an alternative to Christian Science healing.)"
"1","The Christian Scientists' aim is &quot;to reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing&quot; (Manual of The Mother Church, ) which, they believe, was lost after the early centuries of Christianity."
"1","This is a faith in the omnipotence of God, which according to the Christian Science interpretation of the Bible, logically rules out any other power: ."
"1","The Christian Science view is that Jesus taught that we should claim good as being present, right here and now, and that this will result in healing: (; )."
"1","Pravic"
"1","Nothing is said about syntax, morphology or phonology."
"-1","Most Pravic words in the book are proper names (said to be generated randomly by a computer), and they are two-syllable words with five or six phonemes (of the form CVCVC, where C = consonant, V = vowel), if one counts the groups 'sh', 'gv' and 'kv' as single consonants, which they probably are."
"1","'Gv' appears several times word-finally ('Kadagv, Farigv') and word-initially ('Gvarab'), and 'kv' at least once word-initially ('Kvetur'), and once medially ('Takver'); they are suggestive of labiovelar consonants."
"1","Other than that, consonant clusters seem rare; there is a person named Trepil and another named Skovan."
"1","Prasenjit Chatterjee"
"1","It is more like a senior staffer who has put in many years of service in his company feels a sense of belonging, a sense of responsibility for that company."
"-1","It is as simple as that,” says this actor who does not bother about the numerous critics and intellectuals who do not like his acting at all."
"1","He is clearly a director’s actor as his portrayals in the films of Tapan Sinha, Rituparno Ghosh and Buddhadeb Dasgupta go to prove."
"1","His low-profile portrayal of a young boy who runs a bookshop in a small town in Tapan Sinha’s Aatanka is another case in point."
"1","Praline"
"1","The powder made by grinding up such sugar-coated nuts is called 'pralin', and is an ingredient in many cakes, pastries, and ice creams."
"1","When this powder is mixed with chocolate it becomes 'praliné' in French, which gave birth to what is known in French as 'praline belge', 'Belgian chocolates'."
"1","The word 'praliné' is used colloquially in France and Switzerland to refer to these, known simply as 'chocolates' in English i.e. various centres coated with chocolate."
"1","Outside of the United States, the word praline is used to mean this powder, or even a paste, often used to fill chocolates, hence its use by synecdoche in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium to refer to filled chocolates in general."
"1","In the United Kingdom, the term can refer either to praline (the filling for chocolates) or, less commonly, to the original whole-nut pralines."
"1","Prakrit"
"1","'Prakrit' (also transliterated as 'Pracrit') (Sanskrit: ) is the name for a group of Middle Indic, Indo-Aryan languages, derived from Classical Sanskrit and other Old Indic dialects."
"-1","The word itself has a flexible definition, being defined sometimes as, &quot;original, natural, artless, normal, ordinary, usual&quot;, or &quot;vernacular&quot;, in contrast to the literary and religious orthodoxy of ''."
"-1","But there are scholars who believe that prakrit is older than sanskrit and it is on the base of prakrit(original) the language sanskrit(refined) was made."
"1","This also is in tune with the jain religion where the first tirthankar is adinath himself."
"1","The Prakrits became literary languages, generally patronized by kings identified with the Kshatriya caste, but were regarded as illegitimate by the Brahmin orthodoxy."
"1","The various Prakrit languages are associated with different patron dynasties, with different religions and different literary traditions, as well as different regions of the Indian subcontinent."
"1","Prairie Vole"
"1","Though poison is an option to prevent voles, poisoned voles can create a threat to other animals and humans."
"1","Voles are prey for other predators."
"1","In addition, when placing poison near vole entrances, other animals may be able to reach it making it a hazard to them."
"1","In residential areas, the poison itself and poisoned voles can be harmful and/or dangerous to people as well as domesticated animals."
"1","Prairie Knolls Middle School"
"1","On the web page of the Falcons read the following."
"-1","It is hard to believe that we are about ready to say good -bye to our second year at Prairie Knolls Middle School."
"1","Without the dedication and hard work of these individuals, evenings like Explore PKMS would not be possible."
"-1","She has coached for many years and brings many assets to the program."
"1","We wish the best of luck to both Mr. Janisch and Ms. Brackmann."
"1","Prague Astronomical Clock"
"-1","The Orloj stopped working many times in the centuries after 1552, and was repaired many times."
"-1","Some speculate that the government purposely gouged out the original maker's eyes in order to prevent him from making a similar clock for another country."
"1","After this he died touching the clock, at which point the clock stopped working and remained unrepairable for a number of years."
"1","In the 17th century moving statues were added, and figures of the Apostles were added after major repair in 1865-1866."
"1","Pragmatism"
"1","C.S. Peirce considered the idea that beliefs are true at one time but false at another (or true for one person but false for another) to be one of the &quot;seeds of death by which James allowed his pragmatism to become &quot;infected.&quot;"
"1","For Peirce the pragmatic view implies theoretical claims should be tied to verification processes (i.e. they should be subject to test)."
"1","Truth is defined, for Peirce, as what 'would' be the ultimate outcome (not any outcome in real time) of inquiry by a (usually scientific) community of investigators."
"1","Hilary Putnam also developed his internal realism around the idea a belief is true if it is ideally justified in epistemic terms."
"1","Pragmaticism"
"1","In clearness's second grade, he defines truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any definite community of researchers think."
"-1","Then in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic grade), he defines the truth as that which would be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research adequately prolonged, such that the real does depend on that final opinion — a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-term validity of the rule of induction &quot;That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead&quot;, and, given the final ineradicability of error from measurement, not only for the view that space will never be found to be exactly Euclidean &quot;I think we may feel confident that the parallax of the farthest star lies somewhere between -0.'05 and +0.'15, and within another century our grandchildren will surely know whether the three angles of a triangle are greater or less than 180° — that they are exactly that amount is what nobody ever can be justified in concluding.&quot; —, but also for the reality of chance and the real's lack of positive exactness."
"-1","Peirce's discussions and definitions of truth have influenced several epistemic truth theorists and been used as foil for deflationary and correspondence theories of truth."
"1","Pragati Maidan"
"1","It is a huge complex of buildings spread across acres of land sprinkled with many lawns."
"1","The complex houses many pavilions like the Nehru Pavilion, the Defense Pavilion, the Indira Pavilion, and the Son of India Pavilion."
"-1","It has various building which are build in various shapes and sizes."
"-1","Pragati maidan houses a movie theatre called Shakuntalam, it's quite popular among college kids for its comparatively cheap tickets."
"1","Praetorians (video game)"
"1","Members of an alliance may not attack one another."
"1","In times of crisis team members can call upon each other via the message line: &quot;We need help.&quot;"
"1","'Praetorians' differs from other games of its genre in that resources do not play a part in it."
"1","In most real time strategy games, items such as wood, food, gold, stone and glory must be collected, to be spent during the creation of troops."
"1","Pradal Serey"
"-1","While most well-known for its kicking technique, which generates power from hip rotation rather than snapping the leg, pradal serey consists of four types of strikes: punches, kicks, elbows and knee strikes."
"1","Compared to other forms of Southeast Asian kickboxing, pradal serey tends to emphasize more elusive and shifty fighting stances."
"1","The Cambodian style also tends to utilize more elbow techniques than that of other regions."
"1","More victories come by way of an elbow technique than any other strikes."
"1","Practice pad"
"-1","Practice pad implements can be constructed in a variety of shapes and sizes, and by typical design, may be adequately compact (thin) and lightweight for ease in transport."
"-1","A simulation of snare-drum-style resonance can be implied via various hardware features added to the implement."
"-1","These devices can be placed on a myriad of surfaces, including directly onto the top batter head of an actual 14” snare drum or other drum (one possessing a true rim bearing a diameter greater than the total span of the base of the device), which, when struck, could have the added effect of transferring to the drum’s natural snare-side response along with severely muting the sound of the drum."
"-1","Several like units are often mounted in an array, akin to that of a standard drum kit assemblage for practice purposes, and so on."
"1","Practice of law"
"-1","In its most general sense, the 'practice of law' involves giving legal advice to clients, drafting legal documents for clients, and representing clients in legal negotiations and court proceedings such as lawsuits, and is applied to the professional services of a lawyer or attorney at law, barrister, solicitor, or civil law notary."
"-1","However, there is a substantial amount of overlap between the practice of law and various other professions where clients are represented by agents."
"1","Moreover, a growing number of legal document assistants (LDAs) are offering services which have traditionally been offered only by lawyers and their employee paralegals."
"-1","Many documents may now be created by computer-assisted drafting libraries, where the clients are asked a series of questions posed by the software in order to construct the legal documents."
"1","Prachanda"
"1","After which the party came forward with a strategy of democratic republic rather than a people’s republic."
"1","Dr. Bhattarai’s work-strategy has worked out till date, which put forward the party as a major key holder of the nation’s politics."
"1","Chairman Prachanda and Dr. Bhattarai seem at one side keeping some disagreement with the work strategy with the other senior leader Mohan Vaidya alias Kiran."
"1","The two leaders agree strengthening the newly established democratic republic rather than implementing a people’s republic immediately."
"1","Prabhat Kalavidaru"
"1","Prabhat Kalavidaru has produced about 20 ballets; some of which are 'Mohini Bhasmasura', 'Karnataka Vaibhava', 'Kindari Jogi', 'Rama Pratiksha', and 'Punyakoti'."
"1","Lot of experimentation is involved in enacting these dramas like amalgamating Western dance forms with Indian classical dance forms to create some sort of a fusion dance style and also using special lighting techniques to enhance the appeal of the drama."
"1","Prabhat Kalavidaru were one of first theatre groups in India to introduce pre-recorded dialogues and lip-synchronisation."
"-1","The troupe's most popular production to date is Cinderella which has been performed more than a thousand times."
"1","Poeme Symphonique for 100 metronomes"
"1","The piece requires ten &quot;performers&quot;, and most of their efforts take place without the audience present."
"1","Once they are all fully wound they are all started as simultaneously as possible."
"1","As the metronomes wind down one after another and stop, periodicity becomes noticeable in the sound, and individual metronomes can be more clearly made out."
"1","The piece typically ends with just one metronome ticking alone for a few beats."
"1","Poznań 1956 protests"
"1","The 'Poznań 1956 protests' (also known as 'Poznań 1956 uprising' or 'Poznań June' ) were the first of several massive protests of the Polish people against the communist government of the People's Republic of Poland."
"1","A crowd of approximately 100,000 gathered in the city center near the UB secret police building. 400 tanks and 10,000 soldiers of Ludowe Wojsko Polskie and Korpus Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego under Polish-Soviet general Stanislav Poplavsky were ordered to suppress the demonstration and during the pacification fired at the protesting civilians."
"1","The death toll was placed between 57 and 78 people, including a 13-year-old boy, Romek Strzałkowski. Hundreds of people sustained injuries."
"1","Poznań 1956 protests"
"1","Around 80% of its workers, most of whom lost premium pay in June as the government suddenly raised the required work quota, took to the streets demanding pay compensation and some freedom concessions, marching towards the city centre."
"1","Workers at other plants, institutions and students joined the procession."
"1","Between 9:00 am and 11:00 am, about 100,000 people gathered on the Adam Mickiewicz Square in front of the Imperial Castle in Poznań, surrounded by buildings occupied by the city and party authorities and police headquarters."
"1","The demonstrators demanded lower food prices, wage increases and the revocation of some recent changes in the law that had eroded workers' conditions."
"1","Powerlifting"
"1","Powerlifting, in most federations, involves three events: squat, bench press and deadlift."
"1","Some variations of this are found at some meets such &quot;push-pull only&quot; meets where lifters only compete in the bench press and deadlift, with the bench press coming first and the deadlift after."
"1","Single lift meets are often held, sometimes alongside a normal 3-lift event."
"1","This is most common in the bench press."
"1","Powered parachute"
"1","Wind hazards include terrain-induced air disturbances called rotors (it is advisable to stay upwind of trees, mountains, and other obstacles that disturb the flow of the wind)."
"1","Wake turbulence created by the passage of other aircraft, especially aircraft that are heavy, aerodynamically clean, and slow pose another significant hazard."
"1","And since the slow-moving powered parachute (like the helicopter) is particularly well equipped to fly safely near the ground, special care must be taken to avoid power lines, trees, and other low-level terrain obstacles."
"-1","Forced landings in water are extremely dangerous, for pilot and/or passenger may become entangled in the parachute lines of a sinking powered parachute."
"1","Powerback"
"-1","While many aircraft are physically capable of performing powerbacks, many companies impose restrictions on the practice, mainly due to the risk of foreign object damage from debris propelled into the air."
"-1","Northwest Airlines' fleet of DC-9 aircraft used to commonly utilize powerback operations at certian airports, however the airline discontinued the practice in 2005 citing the need to conserve fuel."
"1","In addition, in the United States, restrictions on powerbacks are enforced by the FAA, and the local aviation officials."
"-1","Only certain gates at certain airports are approved for powerbacks, and are usually placarded as such."
"-1","Many airlines impose stricter safety procedures for powerbacks, which often include disallowing a powerback under certain environmental conditions, such as rain or snow."
"1","PowerPC 600"
"-1","In order to achieve an extremely aggressive schedule while including substantially new function (such as substantial performance enhancements, new instructions and importantly POWER/PowerPC's first symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) implementation) the design leveraged a number of key technologies and project management strategies."
"-1","The 601 team leveraged much of the basic structure and portions of the IBM RISC Single Chip (RSC) processor, but also included support for the vast majority of the new PowerPC instructions not in the POWER instruction set."
"-1","While nearly every portion of the RSC design was modified, and many design blocks were substantially modified or completely redesigned given the completely different unified I/O bus structure and SMP/memory coherency support."
"1","Worth noting is that the 601 not only implemented substantial new key functions such as SMP, but it also acted as a bridge between the POWER and the future PowerPC processors to assist IBM, Apple, and other system vendors and software groups in their transitions to PowerPC."
"1","Power: A New Social Analysis"
"1","He claims that, on the one hand, the economic determinists had underestimated the power of opinion."
"1","However, on the other hand, he argues that the case is easy to make that 'all' power is power over opinion: for &quot;Armies are useless unless the soldiers believe in the cause for which they are fighting..."
"1","Law is impotent unless it is generally respected.&quot;"
"1","Still, he admits that military force may cause opinion, and (with few exceptions) be the thing that imbues opinion with power in the first place:"
"1","Power: A New Social Analysis"
"1","First, it must be pursued only as a means to some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals."
"1","Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others."
"1","Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201)."
"1","This is explicitly intended as one possible argument against utilitarianism, though Russell does not take it to be decisive."
"-1","Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216-218)."
"1","Power trio"
"1","During the late 1960s, many groups used power trio instrumentation while adding a vocalist."
"1","These include The Who, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Queen (even though Freddie Mercury, too, was an instrumentalist, some of the band's songs follow this format)."
"-1","Although none of these were ever particularly identified as such, the music that they created is influenced by, and follows the same musical format as, many of the pioneering power trios."
"1","Likewise, Mountain is often erroneously referred to as a power trio, even though there were four instrumentalists (guitar, bass, drums, and keyboards) in the band."
"1","Power ring (DC Comics)"
"1","Violet power rings are fueled by the emotion of love, one of the two emotions (the other being rage) that most influence their user."
"1","At present, members of the Star Sapphires have only been depicted as being female; however, during the 'Blackest Night' panel at Comic Con International 2009, Geoff Johns explained that &quot;anyone can join, but most men are not worthy."
"1","While trapped within these rehabilitation crystals, members of other corps have been shown to be slowly converted into Star Sapphires."
"1","Violet rings are able to detect when true love is being threatened, can create a connection to an embattled heart and use it as a tether, and are also shown as being able to show others their greatest love.'"
"1","Power pop"
"1","The accompanying -selling album, 'Get the Knack', paved the way for major label debuts that fall by The Pop, Shoes, 20/20 and The Beat."
"1","However, &quot;My Sharona&quot;'s ubiquitous radio presence that summer spawned a popular and critical backlash against the band, which in turn led to a backlash against the power pop genre in general."
"1","The Romantics had a minor hit with &quot;What I Like About You&quot; in early 1980, but, by then, power pop was seen as a passing fad by many critics."
"1","Most of this crop of bands continued to release albums throughout the early 1980s, but with the exception of The Romantics' 'In Heat' (1983), none garnered much attention."
"1","Other groups such as The Plimsouls and the dB's found a home on college radio, where power pop would endure for the remainder of the decade."
"1","Power play (sport)"
"1","In lacrosse, a similar type of penalty situation exists, though the duration of the penalty is only 30 seconds for minor infractions and one minute for major ones, as well as 3 minute penalties for certain equipment infractions."
"1","Depending on the infraction, the penalty may &quot;release&quot; early if a goal is scored by either team, or may be &quot;non-releasable,&quot; meaning the full duration must be served."
"1","This situation is also often called an &quot;extra man offense&quot; (EMO) or &quot;man up&quot;, or &quot;man down&quot;, depending on the team penalized."
"1","In indoor soccer, in the forms usually played in the United States, there exists a powerplay situation similar to ice hockey."
"1","Power optimization (EDA)"
"-1","This design practice may require the use of level-shifters when two blocks with different supply voltages communicate with each other."
"1","In the simplest form there are two different thresholds available, common called High-Vt and Low-Vt, where Vt stands for threshold voltage."
"-1","Stacking and parking states: Logic gates may leak differently during logically equivalent input states (say 10 on a NAND gate, as opposed to 01)."
"-1","State machines may have less leakage in certain states."
"1","Power metal"
"1","Power metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with &quot;clean&quot; vocals being much more prevalent than the growled or screamed vocals often associated with death metal and black metal."
"1","Following in the tradition of Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford and other heavy metal vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high register."
"1","The majority of the genre's vocalists sing in the tenor range, capable of hitting very high notes, like Timo Kotipelto of Stratovarius, Michele Luppi of Vision Divine, Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween) or Ralf Scheepers of Primal Fear."
"1","There are however many exceptions such as Pyramaze / Iced Earth frontman Matt Barlow, Falconer frontman Mathias Blad, and Sabaton frontman Joakim Broden; they sing in either baritone or bass range, though in certain songs like Creator Failure, Barlow hits very high notes reminiscent of Rob Halford."
"1","Power cord"
"1","Power cables may be either fixed or detachable from the appliance."
"1","Cords may also have twist-locking features, or other attachments to prevent accidental disconnection at one or both ends."
"1","A cord set may include accessories such as fuses for overcurrent protection, a pilot lamp to indicate voltage is present, or a leakage current detector."
"1","Power cords for sensitive instruments, or audio/video equipment may also include a shield over the power conductors to minimize electromagnetic interference."
"1","Power Shift"
"1","The first Power Shift Conference took place from November 2 to 5, 2007 with between 5,000 and 6,000 students and young people in attendance."
"-1","It is claimed that due to the number of young people who attended the conference, it is the largest activist youth event on climate change in history."
"1","At the University of Maryland, College Park, a rally of between 2,000 and 3,000 people on the steps of the Capitol building and a Lobby Day."
"-1","The event was also attended by a number of keynote speakers which included Al Gore The main aim of the first conference was to urge elected officials to pass legislation which would include three planks taken from the platform of the climate advocacy coalition 1Sky:"
"1","The creation of a 5 million-strong Clean Energy Job Corps"
"-1","The reduction of greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, which scientists say is the baseline for mitigating the worst effects of global warming"
"1","A moratorium on new coal plants and divestment from fossil fuel and highway subsidies."
"1","Power Quest (video game)"
"1","Once you arrive at a location, a character appears on the screen with some dialogue."
"-1","More often than not this dialog involves the character challenging you to a fight."
"-1","You progress through the game by challenging a certain amount of people before the next event is triggered."
"1","Then special events pop up throughout the game after this number is met which usually involve a tournament or beating some strong boss (video games) type character."
"1","Power Movie List"
"1","It lets users catalog movies with detailed information from big movie sites like IMDb, the German Kino.de, and other online-databases."
"-1","The script will download information such as the director, the genre, the production year, and many other information automatically."
"-1","The complete script can still be downloaded from many script sites."
"-1","The IMDB Fetch Script may be out of date, however there are links to updated versions at the end of this article, and in the new support forum."
"1","Power Instinct"
"-1","Gameplay was also improved in some areas, and super attacks were made easier to execute."
"-1","Some allow the player to change certain characteristics of the characters, others are used to view special music video clips, and others to call strange characters to help the player in battle."
"-1","The game has the same backgrounds and all the characters from 'Matrimelee', and because of that it is usually described as a port of the game, while in fact the game's story takes place after the events from the previous game, making it a sort of sequel or update."
"-1","It is possible that this is due to the very little chance of marketing the series ever had outside of its country of origin."
"1","Power (philosophy)"
"-1","One can often overlook unmarked categories."
"-1","Whiteness forms an unmarked category not commonly visible to the powerful, as they often fall within this category."
"1","The unmarked category becomes the norm, with the other categories relegated to deviant status."
"-1","Social groups can apply this view of power to race, gender, and disability without modification: the able body is the neutral body; the 'man' is the normal status."
"1","Pow-wow"
"1","To understand drum protocol, a drum may be thought of as a person or being and is to be regarded and respected as such."
"1","Northern drums are set up on the outside of the dance area, with the host drum in the best position."

"1","They project that if India can achieve 7.3% annual growth over the next 20 years, 465 million more people will be spared a life of extreme deprivation."
"-1","Contrary to popular perceptions, rural India has benefited from this growth: extreme rural poverty has declined from 94% in 1985 to 61% in 2005, and they project that it will drop to 26% by 2025."
"-1","Report concludes that 'India's economic reforms and the increased growth that has resulted have been the most successful anti-poverty programmes in the country'."
"1","Poverty in China"
"1","Market reform has dramatically increased the return to education, as it indicates that there are good opportunities for skilled people and as it creates a powerful incentive for families to increase the education of their children."
"1","Otherwise, inequality can become self-perpetuating: if only high-income people can educate their children, then that group remains a privileged, high-income group permanently."
"-1","China is at some risk of falling into this trap, because it has developed a highly decentralized fiscal system in which local governments rely primarily on local tax collection to provide basic services such as primary education and primary health care."
"-1","China in fact has one of the most decentralized fiscal systems in the world."
"1","Poverty in China"
"1","In the same way that people are either registered as urban or rural, land in China is zoned as either rural or urban."
"1","In urban areas people can easily sell their land and buildings, or mortgage them to borrow."
"-1","The fact that many peasants cannot earn a decent living as farmers is a signal that their labor is more useful in urban employment, hence the hundreds of millions of people who have migrated."
"1","But, at the same time, it is efficient to alienate some of the land out of agriculture for urban use."
"1","Poverty in Africa"
"-1","In addition, most African nations have borrowed substantial sums of money."
"-1","As such, many newly democratic nations in Africa are saddled with debt run up by totalitarian regimes."
"-1","Large debts usually result in little being spent on social services, such as education, pensions, or medical care."

"1","Potts Point, New South Wales"
"1","At the turn of the 21st century, almost all of Potts Point's hotels were acquired by developers attracted by the area's proximity to transportation and amenities."
"-1","By 2004 most tourist hotels had been converted or rebuilt as high end apartment developments, resulting in a rapid wider gentrification of the area - and increasingly large gay community - although the continued presence of a number of large backpacker hostels along with dozens of pubs, nightclubs, restaurants and similar venues have confirmed the suburb's role as one of Sydney's leading entertainment precincts."
"1","Sydney City Council has commenced a major streetscape upgrade centred on Darlinghurst Road and the southern part of Macleay Street, involving footpath-widening, roadside tree-plantings and the installation of new paving, street furniture and lighting."
"1","Plans to force the replacement of historic neon shopfront and awning signage on strip clubs and other adult commercial premises in the area with generic signage proved more controversial and have not been implemented."

"1","Potton Island"
"-1","Unlike some of the other nearby islands which were formerly marshland, Potton Island has been inhabited at least since the Neolithic era."
"1","It was home to several arable farms until it flooded in 1884, leading to its temporary abandonment and longer term use as pasture."
"1","The island was reclaimed in the 1940s but some time after being acquired by the Ministry of Defence in 1955 it reverted to pasture."
"1","It has recently been disclosed (June 2005) that Potton Island was considered by the UK government in the 1980s or 1990s as a potential long term storage site for high level nuclear waste."
"1","Potton"
"-1","King Street, half the Market Square and some of the Brook End area were destroyed."
"-1","It was reported to have burned for a day."
"1","Local people raised L6,000 to help those most in need."
"1","Providing temporary accommodation in nearby fields for the townsfolk alone cost L25,000."
"1","Rebuilding after the fire has left the town with a number of Georgian buildings."
"1","Pottery"
"-1","This is the earliest and the most individualized and direct forming method."
"-1","Wares can be constructed by hand from coils of clay, from flat slabs of clay, from solid balls of clay — or some combination of these."
"1","Parts of hand-built vessels are often joined together with the aid of slurry or slip, a runny mixture of clay and water."
"-1","Some studio potters find hand building more conducive to fully using the imagination to create one-of-a-kind works of art, while others find this with the wheel."
"1","Potteries dialect"
"1","&quot;Nesh&quot; meaning soft, tender, or to easily get cold is derived from the early English, “nesc, nescenes.”"
"1","&quot;Slat&quot; meaning to throw, is from the old English “slath,” moved."
"1","&quot;Fang&quot; meaning catch or seize, as in &quot;Fang 'owt of this&quot; - &quot;catch hold of this&quot;, is from Old English &quot;fang, fangen&quot;."
"1","&quot;Sheed&quot; meaning to spill liquids, most likely derived from the word &quot;shed&quot; in the sense of getting rid of something."
"1","&quot;Cost keck a bow aggen a woe an y'ed it till thee bost it?&quot; meaning, &quot;Can you kick a ball against a wall and head it till you burst it?&quot;"
"1","&quot;Duck&quot; a common term of affection towards both men and women as in &quot;Tow rate owd duck?&quot;."
"1","Duck being derived from the Saxon word &quot;ducas&quot; as a term of respect, which by another route is where the word &quot;Duke&quot; arises from in English."
"-1","Duck in this context may also relate to the Roman military honorific &quot;Dux&quot;, meaning troop or tribal leader, but it is unclear if ducas pre-dates Dux or if they are etymologically related."
"1","&quot;Spanwanned&quot; (agricultural) meaning the state of being stuck astride a wall whilst attempting to climb over it."
"1","Potter's wheel"
"1","Early ceramics built by coiling were often placed on mats or large leaves to allow them to be worked more conveniently."
"-1","The earliest versions of the wheel were probably turned slowly by hand or by foot while coiling a pot, but later developments allowed energy stored in a flywheel to be used to speed up the process of throwing."
"-1","Many modern scholars suggest that it was first developed in Mesopotamia, although Egypt has also been claimed as a possible place of origin."
"1","By the time of the early civilizations of the stone Age the use of the potter's wheel had become widespread."
"1","Potsdamer Platz"
"1","Despite all the devastation, commercial life reappeared in the ruins around Potsdamer Platz within just a few weeks of war’s end."
"1","The lower floors of a few buildings were patched up enough to allow business of a sort to resume."
"1","The new East German state-owned retail business H.O. ('Handelsorganisation', meaning Trading Organisation), had seized almost all of Wertheim’s former assets in the newly-created German Democratic Republic but, unable to start up the giant Leipziger Platz store again (it was too badly damaged), it opened a new 'Kaufhaus' (department store) on the ground floor of Columbushaus."
"1","Since the American, British and Soviet Occupation Zones converged there, people theoretically only had to walk a few paces across sector boundaries to avoid the respective Police officials."
"1","Potluck"
"1","Potluck dinners are often organized by religious or community groups, since they simplify the meal planning and distribute the costs among the participants."
"1","Smaller, more informal get-togethers with distributed food preparation may also be called potlucks."
"1","In some cases each participant agrees ahead of time to bring a single course, and the result is a multi-course meal."
"1","Guests may bring in any form of food, ranging from the main course to desserts."
"1","Potlatch"
"1","Before the arrival of the Europeans, gifts included storable food (oolichan [candle fish] oil or dried food), canoes, and slaves among the very wealthy, but otherwise not income-generating assets such as resource rights."
"-1","Some groups, such as the Kwakwaka'wakw, used the potlatch as an arena in which highly competitive contests of status took place."
"-1","In some cases, goods were actually destroyed after being received, or instead of being given away."
"1","The catastrophic mortalities due to introduced diseases laid many inherited ranks vacant or open to remote or dubious claim-providing they could be validated-with a suitable potlatch."
"1","Potential (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"
"1","Buffy and the other Slayers watch and learn from this example and Buffy lectures the girls on how to deal with vampire attacks."
"1","Buffy has Spike attack her to continue, but she easily gets the upper hand and pins Spike to the ground, reawakening some of his wounds and some feelings for both of them."
"1","They believe the First is taking a brief break from them, but it will come back stronger and better than before."
"1","While Dawn watches silently from the stairs, Buffy tries to give the girls another pep talk."
"1","Potential"
"1","The mathematical study of potentials is known as potential theory; it is the study of harmonic functions on manifolds."
"1","In physics, a 'potential' may refer to the scalar potential or to the vector potential."
"-1","In either case, it is a field defined in space, from which many important physical properties may be derived."
"1","Leading examples are the gravitational potential and the electric potential, from which the motion of gravitating or electrically charged bodies may be obtained."
"1","Potemayo"
"1","At first, she could not say anything but &quot;honi&quot;, a nonsense phrase which she often utters even after learning how to say a few words like Sunao's name."
"1","Potemayo is also telepathic, at least when others are thinking about her Sunao, and becomes violent when she &quot;hears&quot; Mikan even thinking about Sunao."
"1","A small chick named hangs around Potemayo and will often sit on her head."
"1","A running gag with Tori is that it will often eat things made with eggs or chicken, making Sunao call it a cannibal."
"1","Potemayo"
"1","::Guchuko is another mysterious creature that appeared in Sunao's refrigerator, and is somewhat similar to Potemayo in appearance."
"1","The name Guchuko is derived from a small chocolate ball called a guchu which Guchuko likes to eat, and added at the end, since it is a common ending for female given names in Japan."
"-1","Since it was too late to correct, the author stated, &quot;so please take it as a vulgar and savage scythe edged outside, as it would fit Guchuko's character.&quot; with a skull on it, and can fire strong energy beams from two living horns (or possiblyworms) on either side of her head."
"1","She has a very self-sufficient personality, and has only partially warmed up to Kyo, who often gives Guchuko food when at school or at home; Guchuko often repays Kyo by putting pig or cow carcasses in front of her house."
"1","Potawatomi Trail of Death"
"1","The march to Logansport had been under a hot sun through the dust cloud kicked up by the movement of people and animals."
"1","There were sick people and people dying in all directions."
"1","The heat has weakened most if not all of the children."
"1","I baptized several who were newly born - happy Christians, who with their first step pass from earth to heaven."
"1","Potato virus Y"
"1","PVY infection of potato plants results in a variety of symptoms depending on the viral strain."
"1","The mildest of these symptoms is production loss, but the most detrimental is 'potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease' (PTNRD)."
"1","PVY is transmissible by aphid vectors but may also remain dormant in seed potatoes."
"1","This means that using the same line of potato for production of seed potatoes for several consecutive generations will lead to a progressive increase in viral load and subsequent loss of crop."
"1","Potato"
"1","At harvest time, gardeners usually dig up potatoes with a long-handled, three-prong &quot;grape&quot; (or graip), i.e. a spading fork, or a potato hook which is similar to the graip but its tines are at a 90 degree angle to the handle."
"1","This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt."
"1","The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system or &quot;Flying Willard&quot; to separate the potatoes from the plant."
"1","The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck."
"1","Potassium-argon dating"
"1","Due to the long half-life, the technique is most applicable for dating minerals and rocks more than 100,000 years old."
"-1","For shorter timescales, it is likely that not enough Argon 40 will have had time to accumulate in order to be accurately measurable."
"1","Although it finds the most utility in geological applications, it plays an important role in archaeology."
"1","It has also been indispensable in other early east African sites with a history of volcanic activity such as Hadar, Ethiopia."
"1","Potassium nitrate"
"1","Before the large-scale industrial fixation of nitrogen through the Haber process, major sources of potassium nitrate were the deposits crystallizing from cave walls and the draining of decomposing organic material."
"1","Dung-heaps were a particularly common source: ammonia from the decomposition of urea and other nitrogenous materials would undergo bacterial oxidation to produce nitrates."
"1","These often contained calcium nitrate, which could be converted to potassium nitrate by the addition of potash from wood ashes."
"-1","It was and is also used as a component in some fertilizers."
"1","Potassium hydroxide"
"1","KOH attracts numerous specialized applications, which virtually all rely on its basic or degradative properties."
"-1","KOH is widely used in the laboratory for the same purposes."
"1","Its corrosive properties make it useful as an ingredient in cleaning and disinfection of resistant surfaces and materials."
"1","It is often the main active ingredient in chemical &quot;cuticle removers.&quot;"
"-1","KOH is also widely used as a way to remove hair from animal hides, leaving the hides in a solution of KOH and water for a few hours."
"1","Pot washing"
"-1","On the other hand, if you run a larger operation and use a lot of labor to wash pots, it might be worth the extra money to go big."
"1","Essentially custom built for different types of operations and the space configuration available, the larger recirculators are available in three compartment sink sizes with various options."
"1","In addition to requiring a 3 phase supply for the water pump and high-power heater, these larger units have wash sinks with up to 75 U.S. gallons (280 L) of water capacity for handling many pots and pans."
"1","Some of the other options available with recirculators include built-in waste disposers, drain boards of various lengths, shelves over or under and additional scraper sinks."
"1","Postverk Foroya"
"-1","Outside the Faroes, Postverk Foroya is most renowned for its postage stamps."
"1","All stamp editions are about items relating to the Faroes and most of them are designed by Faroese artists."
"-1","Faroese history is a common topic with relevant issues almost each year."
"1","Churches and other Christian motifs play a distinct role before Christmas."
"1","Posttraumatic stress disorder"
"-1","There is some evidence suggesting that administering glucocorticoids immediately after a traumatic experience may help prevent PTSD."
"-1","Several studies have shown that patients who receive high doses of hydrocortisone for treatment of septic shock or following surgery have a lower incidence and fewer symptoms of PTSD."
"-1","In this study, corticosterone impaired memory performance, suggesting that it may reduce risk for PTSD by interfering with consolidation of traumatic memories."
"-1","The neurodegenerative effects of the glucocorticoids, however, may prove this treatment counterproductive."
"1","Postnatal"
"-1","Approximately 25% - 85% of postpartum women will experience the &quot;blues&quot; for a few days."
"-1","Between 7% - 17% may experience clinical depression, with a higher risk among those women with a history of clinical depression."
"1","Despite the wide spread myth of hormonal involvement, repeated studies have not linked hormonal changes with postpartum psychological symptoms."
"1","Rather, these are symptoms of a pre-existing mental illness, exacerbated by fatigue, changes in schedule and other common parenting stressors."
"1","Posting style"
"1","Inline replying was also originally used in all e-mail (because such users had come from Usenet),, but most users and providers have abandoned (or never got used to) this style."
"-1","One possible reason is the large number of casual e-mail users that entered the scene after the popularization of the internet."
"-1","Another possible reason is the inadequate support provided by the reply function of some webmail readers which do not automatically insert in the reply a copy the original message, or do so but without any quoting prefix level indicators."
"-1","Finally, most forums, wiki discussion pages, and blogs (such as Slashdot) essentially impose the bottom-post format, by displaying all recent messages in chronological order."
"1","Postictal state"
"1","There are few explanations for what could cause the long lasting symptoms of the postictal state, with patients complaining of difficulty thinking clearly and loss of short-term memory function for hours and even days."
"-1","Todd’s paresis can last for 24 or 48 hours, and reversible neurological defects (typically short term memory) can last for months, suggesting that more permanent changes in neuron structure may take place following seizures."
"1","It should be noted that most patients do not display any long term neurological defects following seizures, and seizures are not believed to be damaging to the brain."
"-1","It is possible in the small fraction of patients that do experience short term memory loss for weeks or months following a seizure, structural changes may take place that are eventually compensated for structurally or functionally, causing symptoms to eventually disappear."
"1","Postictal state"
"-1","Postictal migraines are a major complaint among epilepsy patients, and can have a variety of etiologies."
"-1","One possible cause of these migraines is high intracranial pressure resulting from postictal cerebral edema."
"1","At times, patients may be unaware that they had a seizure, and the characteristic migraine is their only clue."
"1","Depression is also very common after a seizure."
"1","Posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh"
"1","In the English-speaking world, the Bloomsbury art critics Roger Fry and Clive Bell were his first champions."
"1","Fry, in a 1924 essay, &quot;Vincent Van Gogh,&quot; reported that after Van Gogh's death, he &quot;disappeared&quot; and &quot;scarcely any picture dealer in Bond Street gave him another thought&quot; until the 1910 show titled &quot;Post Impressionist Exhibition&quot; in which &quot;his works dazzled, astonished and infuriated all cultured England.&quot;"
"1","Fry's essay canonized Van Gogh as &quot;a saint&quot; of art, &quot;the victim of the terrible intensity of his convictions-his conviction that somewhere one might lay hold of spiritual values compared with which all other values were of no account.&quot;"
"-1","That set the agenda for many subsequent Van Gogh studies, which are predominantly biographical to this day."
"1","Posthumous fame of El Greco"
"1","To the English artist and critic Roger Fry in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best &quot;with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public&quot;."
"1","Fry described El Greco as &quot;an old master who is not merely modern, but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us, turning back to show us the way&quot;."
"1","During the same period, other researchers developed alternate, more radical theories."
"1","Doctors August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems (possibly progressive astigmatism or strabismus) that made him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the perpendicular."
"1","PostgreSQL"
"-1","The mixed-capitalization of the PostgreSQL name can confuse some people on first viewing."
"-1","The several pronunciations of &quot;SQL&quot; can lead to this confusion."
"-1","It is also common to hear it abbreviated as &quot;'Postgres'&quot;, its original name."
"1","Because of ubiquitous support for the SQL Standard amongst most relational databases, the community considered changing the name back to Postgres."
"1","Postgraduate research"
"1","The nomenclature associated with titles arising from postgraduate research vary from one institution to another and one country to another."
"1","For example, at Bachelor's level, it would be common to receive a BSc(Chemistry)."
"1","There are some exceptions to this."
"1","In a professional Doctorate, where the objective is to demonstrate an in-depth research knowledge of a particular area, the discipline is usually included (e.g., Doctor of Business)."
"1","Postgraduate education"
"1","Private universities' administrations often oppose their graduate students when they try to form unions, arguing that students should be exempt from labor laws intended for &quot;employees&quot;."
"-1","In some cases unionization movements have met with enough student opposition to fail."
"-1","Sometimes only one set of employees will unionize (e.g. teaching assistants, residential directors); at other times, most or all will."
"-1","Typically, fellowship recipients, usually not employed by their university, do not participate."
"1","Postgraduate education"
"1","Many departments, especially those in which students have research or teaching responsibilities, offer tuition-forgiveness and a stipend that pays for most expenses."
"-1","At some elite universities, there may be a minimum stipend established for all Ph.D. students, as well as a tuition waiver."
"1","The terms of these stipends vary greatly, and may consist of a scholarship or fellowship, followed by teaching responsibilities."
"-1","At many elite universities, these stipends have been increasing, in response both to student pressure and especially to competition among the elite universities for graduate students."
"1","Postbeat Poets"
"1","As with blurbs, another way Ginsberg offered appreciation for younger poets was in interviews."
"1","In 1996, with less than a year to live, Gloria G. Brame asked Ginsberg, “Which younger poets do you believe are doing the most promising work?"
"1","Ginsberg responded: “There are quite a few whom I like and with whom I feel a great deal of empathy."
"1","All of these poets at one time or another passed through Naropa."
"1","He met Neal Cassidy before he died and has some of his energy."
"1","I've read with him a number of times… There's a poet called Eliot Katz who lives in New Brunswick, NJ."
"1","His family comes from Germany and most of them were wiped out in the concentration camps… Sapphire (author), a young student of mine at Brooklyn college… She's a black lesbian."
"1","Paul Beatty is another former student of mine: he is a rapper with a literary, be-bop sound."
"1","Postal marking"
"1","'Service marks' provide information to the sender, recipient, or another post office."
"1","(For example, a letter may be marked &quot;snowbank&quot; if snow accumulation not cleared by the potential recipient, or for whatever other reason, makes it difficult or impossible for the carrier to deliver the mail.)"
"-1","Dead letter offices would use various markings to keep track of their progress in finding the addressee, such as a notation that the letter had been advertised in the local newspaper."
"1","The tracking process for registered mail may entail multiple marks, notations and backstamps."
"1","Postal code"
"-1","In some countries (such as those of continental Europe, where a postcode format of four or five numeric digits is commonly used) the numeric postal code is sometimes prefixed with a country code to avoid confusion when sending international mail to or from that country."
"-1","For many years, licence plate codes - for instance &quot;D-&quot; for Germany or &quot;F-&quot; for France - were used, although this was not accepted by the Universal Postal Union (UPU)."
"1","Usage of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes was recommended to be used starting in 1994, but did not become widely used."
"1","The European Committee for Standardization recommends use of ISO Alpha-2 codes for international postcodes and a UPU guide on international addressing states that &quot;administrations may recommend&quot; the use of ISO Alpha-2 codes."
"1","Postage stamps and postal history of the Canal Zone"
"-1","In 1928, the Zone issued a definitive series inscribed &quot;CANAL ZONE POSTAGE&quot; depicting various persons involved in the construction of the canal, as well as a 5 c value showing the Gaillard Cut."
"1","A series of 16 stamps in 1939 commemorating the 25th anniversary of the canal's completion showed &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; views of various points along the canal."
"-1","Thereafter stamps appeared at an average rate of about two per year, with a commemorative set in some years and no stamps in others."
"-1","This paralleled the abandonment of the word &quot;POSTAGE&quot; on many United States stamps, as the United States ceased to issue revenue stamps."
"1","Postage stamps and postal history of Mexico"
"1","In 1856, Mexico issued its first adhesive postage stamps, with &quot;district overprints&quot;, a unique feature among postal systems worldwide, employed to combat theft of postage stamps."
"-1","From the late 19th century, Mexico's stamps were generally conservative in design and often manufactured abroad."
"1","The Mexican Revolution and ensuing Civil Wars (1910-1920), however, threw Mexico into upheaval and resulted in numerous provisional and local stamps issued by the factions in control of different areas of the country."
"1","In the years preceding World War II, the look of Mexico's stamps changed dramatically, with many stamps displaying the works of modern Mexican abstract and mural artists."
"1","Postage stamp color"
"-1","In general, collectors follow the stamp catalogs in matters of color nomenclature, even though the different catalogs are not consistent with each other."
"-1","Although there are a great many named colors, the selection used by philatelists is limited to several dozen, modified by adjectives such as &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;light&quot;, &quot;pale&quot;, &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;deep&quot;."
"1","In addition, two color names may be combined, as in &quot;gray green&quot; or &quot;brown orange&quot;, where the first name indicates the direction of modification to the second color."
"1","This system becomes less clear when extended to other colors, and few collectors could describe precisely how &quot;carmine rose&quot; is different from &quot;rose carmine&quot;."
"1","Post-structuralism"
"-1","The movement is difficult to define or summarize, but may be broadly understood as a body of distinct responses to structuralism (hence the prefix &quot;post&quot;)."
"1","Many contributors, most notably Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Julia Kristeva, either inverted structuralist principles or set out to reject them outright."
"1","In direct contrast to the structuralist claim of an independent signifier superior to the signified, post-structuralism generally views the signifier and signified as inseparable but not united; meaning itself inheres to the play of difference."
"1","Anti-humanism, as a rejection of the enlightenment subject, is often a central tenet."
"1","Post-rock"
"1","Vocals are often omitted from post-rock; however, this does not necessarily mean they are absent entirely."
"-1","When vocals are included, the use is typically non-traditional: some post-rock bands employ vocals as purely instrumental efforts and incidental to the sound, rather than a more traditional use where &quot;clean&quot;, easily-interpretable vocals are important for poetic and lyrical meaning."
"-1","When present, post-rock vocals are often soft or droning and are typically infrequent or present in irregular intervals."
"-1","Sigur Rós, a band known for their distinctive vocals, fabricated a language that critics call &quot;Hopelandic&quot; (Vonlenska in icelandic, a term even used by the band), which has been described by the band as &quot;a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music and acts as another instrument.&quot;"
"1","Post-polio syndrome"
"1","Because PPS can fatigue facial muscles, as well as cause dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking) or aphonia (inability to produce speech), persons with PPS may become malnourished due to difficulty eating."
"1","Severe cases may require permanent ventilation or tracheostomy."
"1","Sleep apnoea may also occur."
"1","Other management strategies that may lead to improvement improvement include smoking cessation, treatment of other respiratory diseases and vaccination against respiratory infections such as influenza."
"1","Post-metal"
"1","The general philosophy behind post-metal production is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, so each instrument is usually given about equal presence."
"1","Vocals are often not particularly high in the mix, and in most cases are &quot;barked&quot; in the style of hardcore punk or metal, i.e. guttural and shouted, rather than growled in death metal."
"1","Lyrics cover a broad spectrum of issues, usually somewhat metaphysical, existentialist or macroscopic, as opposed to deeply personal or directly allegorical."
"1","Themes often include political dissatisfaction, or criticism of herd mentality."
"1","Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present"
"1","Amarah: A roadside bomb killed one and wounded three others in Amarah."
"1","Tal Afar: A roadside bomb in Tal Afar killed four, including a policeman, and wounded eight other people."
"1","Mosul: Six people were shot dead, including one policeman."
"1","Baqubah: Eight people were killed in different incidents."
"1","Post-industrial music"
"1","'Power noise' (also known as 'rhythmic noise') takes its inspiration from some of the more structured and distorted early industrial acts, such as Esplendor Geométrico."
"1","Hymen Records, Converter, Coma record description."
"-1","Power noise groups meld noise music with various forms of electronic dance music."
"1","Access date: August 8, 2008. Typically, power noise is based upon a distorted kick drum from a drum machine such as a Roland TR-909, uses militaristic 4/4 beats, and is usually instrumental."
"1","Sometimes a melodic component is added, but this is almost always secondary to the rhythm."
"1","Post-cult trauma"
"1","He further writes in the article that the clear majority of those who leave of their own free will speak positively of certain aspects of their past experience."
"-1","While readily acknowledging the ways a given religious movement failed to meet their personal expectations and spiritual needs, many voluntary defectors have found ways of salvaging some redeeming values from their previous religious associations and activities."
"-1","But there are some voluntary apostates from new religious movements who leave deeply embittered and harshly critical of their former religious associations and activities."
"1","Long-term and heavily involved members of new religious movements who over time become disenchanted with their religion often throw all of the blame on their former religious associations and activities. [...]"
"1","Post-credits scene"
"1","Using humor in such scenes is also still common for more serious films, as in the film 'Daredevil', in which Bullseye is shown after his defeat by Daredevil in a full body cast."
"1","Another example happens in 'Hellboy' when Tom Manning is shown still wandering around the catacombs when he was last seen previously in the film when the other major players have left."
"1","Other films eschew the comedy in favor of a twist or revelation that would be out of place elsewhere in the movie, as in 'X-Men: The Last Stand's post-credits scene, which suggests that Professor X may have transferred his mind to the body of a comatose patient (which was revealed in the DVD commentary to be the identical twin of Charles Xavier, whose mind had been crippled and destroyed due to Charles's growing powers in their mother's womb)."
"1","In 'Iron Man', Samuel L. Jackson makes a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, who wants to talk to Tony Stark about the &quot;Avenger Initiative&quot; (Jackson will reprise the role in other Marvel films, including 'The Avengers', 'Iron Man 2', 'Thor', and 'The First Avenger: Captain America')."
"1","Post-concussion syndrome"
"1","Ongoing disabilities may be treated with therapy to improve function at work, or in social or other contexts."
"1","Therapy aims to aid in the gradual return to work and other preinjury activities, as symptoms permit."
"1","CBT may help prevent persistence of iatrogenic symptoms – those that occur because health care providers create the expectation that they will."
"1","A risk exists that the &quot;power of suggestion&quot; may worsen symptoms and cause long-term disabilities; therefore, when counseling is indicated, the therapist must take a psychological origin of symptoms into account and not assume that all symptoms are a direct result of neurological damage from the injury."
"1","Post-Zionism"
"-1","Post-Zionism is a term associated with a variety of perceptions and different positions, behind which stands criticism of the core beliefs of Zionist groups."
"-1","Post-Zionists raise many questions about Zionism and the state of Israel, among them:"
"1","Is the state of Israel indeed a safe shelter for the Jewish nation?"
"1","Are there any other places in the world in which the Jews' conditions are better from a historical point of view?"
"1","(For example North America)"
"1","Is it really possible to have both a Jewish state and a democracy?"
"1","Post-September 11 anti-war movement"
"1","The groups have collaborated at times on events, although collaboration has not always been easy."
"-1","In perhaps the most infamous incident, Rabbi Michael Lerner was banned from speaking at a February 16, 2003 anti-war rally in San Francisco, less than a month before the U.S. invaded Iraq."
"-1","It was generally believed that this was done at ANSWER's behest, because Lerner had been critical of what he perceives as ANSWER's anti-Israel politics."
"1","Lerner, though irked that NION and UFPJ did not stand up for his inclusion as a speaker, continued to encourage people to attend the rally."
"1","Post-Confederation Canada (1867-1914)"
"-1","While MacDonald may have hoped that the BNA Act would provide the central government in Ottawa with a strong hand, some of the provinces, particularly Ontario under the leadership of its premier Oliver Mowat, pushed for interpretations of the Constitution that favoured provincial rather than Dominion interests."
"1","Mowat sent police and government officials into the disputed territory to assert Ontario's claims, while Manitoba (at the behest of the national government) did the same."
"1","The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which served as Canada's highest appeal court until 1949, repeatedly issued rulings taking the side of provincial rights."
"1","These decisions would to some extent neutralize the power of the central government, creating a decentralized federation quite different from what Sir John A. Macdonald had envisioned."
"1","&quot;By the eve of the First World War, Confederation had evolved into a creation beyond John A. Macdonald's worst nightmare."
"1","Powerful, independent provinces, sovereign within their own spheres, manipulated the rights of property, levied their own taxes--even income taxes, in a few cases--exploited their natural resources, and managed schools, hospitals, and relief for the poor, while a weak and ineffectual central government presided over not much of anything in the drab little capital on the banks of the Ottawa.&quot;"
"1","Post vacation blues"
"-1","A person may suffer from post vacation blues after returning home or to a normal routine from a long vacation, especially if it was a pleasurable one."
"-1","The longer a trip lasts, the more intense the post vacation blues may be."
"-1","Post vacation blues may result in tiredness, loss of appetite, strong feelings of nostalgia, and in some cases, depression."
"-1","Jet lag may intensify the post vacation blues."
"1","Post Tribulation Rapture"
"1","Opposing doctrines include:"
"1","'Midtribulationists' believe that the rapture of the faithful will occur halfway through the Tribulation, after it begins, and will endure the phase of the Tribulation which tests their faith, but that they will be removed before the last half occurs, because that three and one-half year period is manifestly dominated by the wrath of God falling on those who reject him, Supporters of this view often cite 1 Thessalonians 5.9, &quot;For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ."
"1","&quot;"
"1","'Pretribulationists' believe that all Christians then alive will be taken bodily up to Heaven (called the rapture) before the Tribulation begins."
"1","They often quote 2 Thessalonians 2.6,7 to support the idea that the Holy Spirit will be withdrawn as a stabilizing influence on secular society (Matt 5.13) through the removal of the Church."
"1","Those who become converts after the rapture will, like the Old Testament saints, not be indwelt by the Holy Spirit in the same sense as Christians are said to be today."
"1","Post Secondary Transition For High School Students with Disabilities"
"1","Public Law 108-446, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004, is most commonly called IDEA 2004."
"1","Following enactment, the U.S. Department of Education took nearly two years to develop the federal regulations to answer common questions about critical parts of the law."
"-1","To some extent, the federal regulations clarify how the law should be put into practice."
"-1","In some areas the final implementation of the law is up to the state educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) - the public school districts."
"1","Post Reditum in Senatu"
"1","VI. 13 And when in the Circus Flaminius3 (I will not say the consul had been conducted into the assembly by a tribune of the people, but) the archpirate had been brought in by another robber, he came first a man of what exceeding dignity, full of wine, sleep, and debauchery! with hair dripping with ointments, with carefully arranged locks, with heavy eyes, moist cheeks, a husky and drunken voice; and he, a grave authority, said that he was greatly displeased at citizens having been executed without having been formally condemned."
"1","For that other man, Caesoninus Calventius, from his youth up has been habituated to the forum, though, except his assumed and crafty melancholy, there was no single thing to recommend him,—no knowledge of the law, no skill in speaking, no knowledge of military affairs or of men, no liberality."
"1","And he has masters, none of those foolish fellows who go on for whole days discussing duty and virtue,—who exhort men to labour, to industry, to encounter dangers for the sake of their country, but men who argue that no hour ought to be unoccupied by pleasure; that in every part of the body there ought always to be some joy and delight to be perceived."
"1","15 He uses his masters as a sort of superintendents of his lusts; they seek out and scent out all sorts of pleasures; they are the seasoners and furnishers of his banquets they appraise and value the different pleasures, they give a formal decision and judgment as to how much indulgence ought to be allowed to each separate pleasure."
"1","He, becoming accomplished in all these arts, despised this most prudent city to such a degree that he thought that all his lusts and all his atrocities could be concealed, if he only thrust his ill-omened face into the forum."
"1","Positron emission tomography"
"1","Radionuclides used in PET scanning are typically isotopes with short half lives such as carbon-11 (~20 min), nitrogen-13 (~10 min), oxygen-15 (~2 min), and fluorine-18 (~110 min). These radionuclides are incorporated either into compounds normally used by the body such as glucose (or glucose analogues), water or ammonia, or into molecules that bind to receptors or other sites of drug action."
"1","Such labelled compounds are known as radiotracers."
"-1","It is important to recognize that PET technology can be used to trace the biologic pathway of any compound in living humans (and many other species as well), provided it can be radiolabeled with a PET isotope."
"1","Due to the short half lives of most radioisotopes, the radiotracers must be produced using a cyclotron and radiochemistry laboratory that are in close proximity to the PET imaging facility."
"1","Positron emission tomography"
"1","Limitations to the widespread use of PET arise from the high costs of cyclotrons needed to produce the short-lived radionuclides for PET scanning and the need for specially adapted on-site chemical synthesis apparatus to produce the radiopharmaceuticals."
"-1","Few hospitals and universities are capable of maintaining such systems, and most clinical PET is supported by third-party suppliers of radiotracers which can supply many sites simultaneously."
"1","This limitation restricts clinical PET primarily to the use of tracers labelled with F-18, which has a half life of 110 minutes and can be transported a reasonable distance before use, or to rubidium-82, which can be created in a portable generator and is used for myocardial perfusion studies."
"1","Nevertheless, in recent years a few on-site cyclotrons with integrated shielding and hot labs have begun to accompany PET units to remote hospitals."
"1","Positive feedback"
"1","Simple systems that clearly separate the inputs from the outputs are not prone to systemic risk."
"1","This risk is more likely as the complexity of the system increases, because it becomes more difficult to see or analyze all the possible combinations of variables in the system even under careful stress testing conditions."
"1","The more efficient a complex system is, the more likely it is to be prone to systemic risks, because it takes only a small amount of deviation to disrupt the system."
"1","Therefore well-designed complex systems generally have built-in features to avoid this condition, such as a small amount of friction, or resistance, or inertia, or time delay to decouple the outputs from the inputs within the system."
"1","Positive airway pressure"
"-1","In many countries PAP machines are only available by prescription."
"1","A sleep study at an accredited sleep lab is usually necessary before treatment can start."
"-1","A sleep medicine doctor, who may be also trained in respiratory medicine, psychiatry, neurology, pediatrics, family practice or otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat), will interpret the results from the initial sleep study and recommend a pressure from test."
"-1","This may be done in one night (a split study with the diagnostic testing done in the first part of the night, and CPAP testing done in the later part of the night) or with a follow up second sleep study during which the CPAP titration may be done over the entire evening."
"1","Poseur Ink"
"-1","Almost twice the size of 'Side A', 'Side B' contains stories by comic staples like Jim Mahfood, Jeffrey Brown, and Ryan Kelly; as well as Xeric Grant winners: Box Brown, Colleen Frakes and many others"
"1","Released in June 2009, the book was favorably reviewed by the vast majority of those who picked it up."
"1","Johanna Draper Carlson ('Comics Worth Reading') said it was &quot;the best anthology [she had] read this year,&quot; in her 2009 MoCCA report."
"1","The music e-zine Absolute Punk gave away three copies of the book to its users, introducing their users to Poseur Ink's other comics and products."
"1","Poser porn"
"1","The freedom allowed by using computer-generated imagery allows pornographic (erotic) artists to create scenes or scenarios that would not be possible (or legal) within the realm of live action shooting."
"-1","Therefore, many Poser pornographic artists choose to create fantastical scenes that may feature animals, monsters, aliens, magical or supernatural elements or far-fetched BDSM scenarios."
"-1","Violent and disturbing imagery may also be seen in such computer-generated porn."
"1","Another popular sub genre of Poser porn that exploits the freedom of computer-generated porn appeals to vorarephiles (this form of Poser porn falls under the vore category)."
"1","Poser"
"1","Poser has become a popular tool for digital artists creating original images featuring human figures."
"1","While Poser has animation capability, this use is less common."
"1","Poser figures and animations have been seen in some computer games from budding game creators (Desert Rifle-Qi games and Cake shop-Elefun games)."
"-1","Infography present in several science and technology magazines around the world is often Poser retouched or postworked models."
"1","Poser"
"1","Poser comes with a host of features, such as the inclusion of &quot;Primitive&quot; zygotes; spheres, cubes and other shapes at both low and high resolution."
"1","As with Poser 5.0, it is compatible with 3ds Max, LightWave and Maya, which enables Poser version 6.0 and higher to render more than simply people."
"1","Indeed, Poser has become almost limitless in the characters it can render."
"1","As a result of its huge third-party community, many models are available, such as spaceships, aliens, weapons, scenes, buildings, and other such props."
"1","Porvorim"
"1","A second city, Mapusa, is situated some 7 kilometers from here."
"1","Tourist folks usually visit this peaceful paradise to enjoy some leisure."
"1","As of the other parts of Goa, Konkani remains the predominantly spoken language."
"1","There are also some villages close by such as Guirim, Aldona, Assanora, Thivim"
"1","Portulaca oleracea"
"-1","The species status in the New World is uncertain: it is generally considered an exotic weed; however, there is evidence that the species was in Crawford Lake deposits (Ontario) in 1430-89, suggesting that it reached North America in the pre-Columbian era."
"-1","It is naturalised elsewhere and in some regions is considered an invasive weed."
"1","The flowers appear depending upon rainfall and may occur year round."
"1","The flowers open singly at the center of the leaf cluster for only a few hours on sunny mornings."
"1","Portuguese transition to democracy"
"1","Francisco Sá Carneiro, the dynamic leader of the PSD and a fierce personal rival of Soares, put together a coalition of his own PSD along with the CDS, the Popular Monarchist Party (Partido Popular Monárquico — PPM), and another small party to form the Democratic Alliance (Aliança Democrática — AD)."
"1","The coalition won 45.2% of the vote in the elections, or 128 seats, for a majority of 3 in the 250-seat assembly."
"-1","The PS, which had also formed an electoral coalition with several small left-wing groups, suffered a drubbing and won only 27.4%, a large drop compared with 1976 results."
"1","The PCP, in coalition with another left-wing party, gained slightly."
"1","Portuguese people"
"-1","According to a highly criticized recent study that was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics in December 2008 by Adams et al., about 30 percent of modern Portuguese (23.6 in the north and 36.3 in the south) have DNA reflecting what can be a male Sephardic Jewish ancestry and about 14 % (11.8 in the north and 16.1% in the south) have a probable Moorish ancestry, Adams et al. 2008."
"1","Despite alternative possible sources for lineages ascribed a Sephardic Jewish origin, these proportions attest to a high level of religious conversion (whether voluntary or enforced), driven by historical episodes of social and religious intolerance, that ultimately led to the integration of descendants."
"1","&quot;'Despite alternative possible sources for lineages' ascribed a Sephardic Jewish origin'&quot;, &quot;They are really assuming that they are looking at this migration of Jewish immigrants, but the same lineages could have been introduced in the Neolithic&quot; said Stephen Oppenheimer."
"-1","On the other hand, Chris Tyler-Smith, an expert on Y-chromosome genetics and a collaborator with the team that carried the study , argues that the individual differences in Y-chromosome markers suggest that Iberians and Sephardic Jews must share ancestry more recent than several millennia, ."
"1","Portuguese literature"
"1","The novel is really a creation of the nineteenth century and it began with historical romances in the style of Walter Scott by Alexandre Herculano de Carvalho e Araujo, to whom succeeded Rebello da Silva with 'A Mocidade de D. Joao V', Andrade Corvo, and others."
"1","The romance of manners is due to the versatile Camillo Castello Branco, a rich impressionist who describes to perfection the life of the early part of the century in 'Amor de Perdiçao', 'Novellas do Minho', and other books."
"1","Gomes Coelho (Julio Dinis), a romantic idealist and subjective writer, is known best by 'As Pupillas do Snr Reitor', but the great creative artist was José Maria de Eça de Queiroz, founder of the Naturalist School, and author of 'Primo Basilio', 'Correspondencia de Fradique Mendes', 'A Cidade e as Serras'."
"1","His characters live and many of his descriptive and satiric passages have become classical."
"1","Portuguese literature"
"1","Meanwhile the people were elaborating a ballad poetry of their own, the body of which is known as the 'Romanceiro'."
"1","It consists of lyrico-narrative poems treating of war, chivalry, adventure, religious legends, and the sea, many of which have great beauty and contain traces of the varied civilizations which have existed in the peninsula."
"1","When the Court poets had exhausted the artifices of Provencal lyricism, they imitated the poetry of the people, giving it a certain vogue which lasted until the Classical Renaissance."
"1","It was then thrust into the background, and though cultivated by a few, it remained unknown to men of letters until the nineteenth century, when Almeida-Garrett began his literary revival and collected folk poems from the mouths of the peasantry."
"1","Portuguese literature"
"1","His principal defect is monotony: his own self is his solitary theme, and he seldom attempts any other form of composition than the sonnet."
"-1","On the other hand, few poets who have chiefly devoted themselves to this form have produced so large a proportion of really exquisite work."
"-1","The comparatively few pieces in which be either forgets his doubts and inward conflicts, or succeeds in giving them an objective form, are among the most beautiful in any literature."
"-1","The purely introspective sonnets are less attractive, but equally finely wrought, interesting as psychological studies, and impressive from their sincerity."
"1","Portuguese alphabet"
"1","Only the most frequent sounds are given below, since a listing of all cases and exceptions would be too cumbersome."
"1","Portuguese is a pluricentric language, and the pronunciation of some of the letters is different in European Portuguese (EP) and Brazilian Portuguese (BP)."
"1","Apart from these variations, the pronunciation of most consonants is fairly straightforward, and similar to French or Catalan pronunciation."
"1","Only the consonants 'r', 's', 'x', 'z', the digraphs 'ch', 'lh', 'nh', 'rr', and the vowels may require special attention from English speakers."
"1","Portuguese Wikipedia"
"-1","The Portuguese language Wikipedia is different from the English one in a number of aspects."
"1","Proposed deletion is unavailable."
"1","This was decided via another voting process."
"1","On-going campaigns are reuniting people in favour and against the usage of fair use."
"1","However, if one rewrites the article in another dialect (provided content was changed, not merely the language), but leave some words in the former dialect, these words should be rewritten in accordance with the new version's dialect of the article."
"1","Portuguese Gothic architecture"
"1","During the Gothic era, several castles had to be either built or reinforced, especially along the border with the Kingdom of Castille."
"1","Compared to previous castles, Gothic castles in Portugal tended to have more towers, often of circular or semi-circular plan (to increase resistance to projectiles), keep towers tended to be polygonal, and castle gates were often defended by a pair of flanking towers."
"1","A second, lower wall curtain (barbicans) were often built along the perimeter of the main walls to prevent war machines from approaching the castle."
"1","Features like machicolations and improved arrowslits became also widespread."
"1","Portuguese East Africa"
"1","In the 1940s, the integration of traditional authorities into the colonial administration was deepened, a level of social integration, miscegenation and social promotion based in skill and human qualities of each individual, rather than in the ethnic background, which was coined 'lusotropicalismo' and had been a major feature of the Portuguese Empire throughout history."
"1","Gradually, these &quot;traditional&quot; titles lost some of their content, and the 'régulos' and 'cabos de terra' came to be viewed as an effective part of the colonial state, remunerated for their participation in the collection of taxes, recruitment of the labor force, and agricultural production in the area under their control."
"1","In major urban areas, most notoriously the cosmopolitan provincial ports of Lourenço Marques and Beira, racial integration and socioeconomic opportunities for all kind of skilled citizens were already very deep."
"1","From then on, all Africans were considered Portuguese citizens, and racial discrimination became a sociological rather than a legal feature of colonial society."
"1","Portugal"
"-1","Other minor influences include some 5th century vestiges of Alan settlement, which were found in Alenquer, Coimbra and even Lisbon."
"-1","A victory over the Muslims at Ourique in 1139 is traditionally taken as the occasion when Portugal was transformed from a county (County of Portugal as a fief of the Kingdom of León) into an independent kingdom: the Kingdom of Portugal."
"1","Guimaraes - the city is known as the cradle of Portugal."
"1","On 24 June 1128, the Battle of Sao Mamede occurred near Guimaraes."

"1","Doctor Robert F Kaiko inventor of the popular opioid analgesic 'Oxycontin' went to school in Portstewart."
"1","He was then part of Paul McCartney's group Wings, before moving onto other groups."
"1","Portsmouth Block Mills"
"1","These machines utilised several features for the first time which have since become commonplace in machine design."
"1","The boring operation indented gauging points in the wooden blocks which the clamps of the later machines used to locate the blocks precisely."
"1","This meant that positioning of the block in later processes ensured accurate location in relation to the tool working on it."
"1","several of the machines had cone clutches."
"1","Brunel used detachable tool bits held in tool holders very similar to those use now on general purpose lathes."
"1","Expanding collet chucks were used to locate the sheaves by gripping the internal bore, during certain operations."
"1","Two-jaw gripping chucks were used on some machines."
"1","These were precursors of the three-jaw chucks used on lathes today."
"1","The morticing machines could be set to stop automatically once the operation was finished."
"1","Interchangeability of the sheaves and pins was possible, since they were not married to a particular shell."
"1","The work-flow is perhaps best described as batch production, because of the range of block sizes demanded."
"-1","This method of working did not catch on in general manufacturing in Britain for many decades, and when it did it was imported from America."
"1","Portraits of Shakespeare"
"-1","New scientific tests on the label suggest that it dates to Shakespeare's lifetime, which, if true, would make this a likely authentic image of Shakespeare."
"-1","It is attributed by a family tradition to one John Sanders or possibly his brother Thomas."
"1","The inscription on the label &quot;This likeness taken&quot; has been criticised as not a contemporary formulation."
"-1","It is no longer attributed to him, nor is there any evidence to identify it as Shakespeare, however it was probably painted during his lifetime and may depict a poet."
"1","Portrait photography"
"1","Most lights used in modern photography are a flash of some sort."
"1","This provides a softer lighting for portrait work and is often considered more appealing than the harsh light often cast by open strobes."
"1","Hair and background lights are usually not diffused."
"1","It is more important to control light spillage to other areas of the subject."
"1","Portrait photography"
"1","'Portrait photography' is the capture by means of photography of the likeness of a person or a small group of people (a group portrait), in which the face and expression is predominant."
"1","Like other types of portraiture, the focus of the photograph is the person's face, although the entire body and the background may be included."
"1","A portrait is generally not a snapshot, but a composed image of a person in a still position."
"1","A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the camera."
"1","Portrait painting"
"1","In most cases, this results in a serious, closed lip stare, with anything beyond a slight smile being rather rare historically."
"1","Even given these limitations, a full range of subtle emotions is possible from quiet menace to gentle contentment."
"1","As author and artist Gordon C. Aymar states, &quot;the eyes are the place one looks for the most complete, reliable, and pertinent information&quot; about the subject."
"1","And the eyebrows can register, &quot;almost single-handedly, wonder, pity, fright, pain, cynicism, concentration, wistfulness, displeasure, and expectation, in infinite variations and combinations.&quot;"
"1","Portrait painting"
"1","Among the other possible variables, the subject can be clothed or nude; indoors or out; standing, seated, reclining; even horse-mounted."
"1","Portrait paintings can be of individuals, couples, parents and children, families, or collegial groups."
"1","They can be created in various media including oils, watercolor, pen and ink, pencil, charcoal, pastel, and mixed media."
"1","Artists may employ a wide-ranging palette of colors, as with Pierre-Auguste Renoir's 'On The Terrace' (1881) or restrict themselves to mostly white or black, as with Gilbert Stuart's 'Portrait of George Washington' (1796)."
"1","Portrait"
"1","'Portrait photography' is a popular commercial industry all over the world."

"1","Since the dawn of photography, people have made portraits."
"-1","Studios sprang up in cities around the world, some cranking out more than 500 plates a day."
"1","Subjects were generally seated against plain backgrounds and lit with the soft light of an overhead window and whatever else could be reflected with mirrors."
"1","Portobello, Dublin"
"1","As a fast-expanding suburb during the 19th century Portobello attracted many upwardly-mobile families whose members went on to play important roles in politics, the arts and the sciences."
"1","Although usually referred to as Portobello Bridge, the correct name is La Touche Bridge (named after William Digges La Touche (1747-1803), scion of a prominent Dublin business family and a director of the Grand Canal Company)."
"1","For some unaccountable reason he took his army over to Finglas, where he spent a month, which allowed the Roundheads to reinforce and plan their attack."

"-1","They can be pricey, if compared to other towns, but they are also an easier, safer and more dependable option than buses in some cases."
"1","To ride a cab, one can walk to the nearest &quot;taxi stop&quot; (usually in crowded areas or points of interest), wave for an empty passing cab or call a tele-táxi service."
"1","Tele-táxi may charge extra for this service."
"1","The price of the fare is determined by a machine called taxímetro, usually in front of the passenger seat."
"1","Portland, Louisville"
"-1","Although now just a neighborhood of the much larger Louisville, Portland would continue to flourish as a working class community through the 1930s, with residents working in many of the nearby factories."
"-1","Both floods had driven many middle class families from the area."
"-1","Despite the loss of many of area's oldest buildings, portions of the neighborhood away from the flood wall were largely untouched by urban renewal, and retain a great number of pre-Civil War buildings."
"-1","Although many older mansions exist in Portland, the vast majority of homes built in the area were shotgun houses."
"1","Portland General Electric"
"1","Then in 1999, and again in 2001, Enron attempted to sell PGE to other investor-owned utilities including Portland based NW Natural."
"1","'The corporate officers of PGE have claimed that this utility was not involved in the financial misdealings of its owner, pointing to the fact that many of its employees suffered when Enron froze the 401(k) retirement plan and were unable to sell the rapidly declining stock."
"1","However, Ken Harrison and Joseph Hirko, PGE's CEO and CFO respectively at the time of the Enron merger were charged on several felony level counts primarily related to financial misrepresentation regarding Enron Broadband Services which had its headquarters within the World Trade Center complex that comprises PGE's corporate offices."
"1","In addition Tim Belden, head of the West Coast Trading Desk and John Forney, an energy trader who invented various electricity trading strategies such as the 'Death Star', operated from the trading floor in the PGE corporate offices and were also convicted of financial crimes related to the California Electricity Crisis."
"1","Portia (genus)"
"1","Laboratory studies show that 'Portia' learns very quickly how to overcome web-building spiders that neither it nor its evolutionary ancestors would have met in the wild."
"1","On the other hand they will use a head-on approach against spitting spiders that are carrying eggs."
"1","Against other jumping spiders, which also have excellent vision, 'Portia's may mimic fragments of leaf litter detritus."
"1","On the other hand they simply stalk and rush unarmed prey such as flies, and also capture prey by means of sticky webs."
"1","Portevin–Le Chatelier effect"
"-1","The 'Portevin–Le Chatelier effect' describes a serrated stress-strain curve, which some materiels exhibit as they undergo plastic deformation."
"1","This effect occurs, when solute atoms (e.g C in steels) have sufficient mobility and thus can segregate at a dislocation core."
"1","When a freed dislocation runs through thr crystal it disturbs other locked dislocations, and may cause an avalanche-like freeing of dislocations."
"1","Since this process can happen several times, it leads to serrations in the curve."
"-1","Due to the localized deformations some materials, e.g., aluminum-magnesium alloys, develop a rough surface during deformation processes, rendering them useless for autobody or casing applications."
"1","Porter Wagoner"
"1","The shows usually featured opening performances by Wagoner with performances by Jean, or later Parton, and comedic interludes by Rhodes."
"1","During Parton's tenure, she and Wagoner usually sang a duet (Wagoner did not duet with Norma Jean)."
"1","Each episode also featured a guest who would usually perform one or two songs."
"1","A spiritual or gospel performance was almost always featured toward the end of the show; generally performed by either Wagoner or Parton, or the show's guest star, or occasionally the entire cast."
"1","Porte des Morts"
"-1","Some say it has more shipwrecks than any other section of fresh water in the world."
"1","Winds on the Great Lakes are notoriously unpredictable and can increase to gale forces and more almost without warning."
"1","Plum Island and tiny Pilot Island are almost in the very middle of what is commonly considered Death's Door and thereby pose hazards."
"1","While the Porte des Morts Passage proper to the south of Plum Island is relatively hazard free, the Detroit Island Passage to the north of Plum Island has many."
"1","Portal hypertensive gastropathy"
"1","The diagnosis of portal hypertensive gastropathy is usually made on endoscopy."

"-1","The R. M. Kellogg farms also maintained a popular tourist attraction, the Kellogg Gardens, elaborate gardens with many unusual structures, next to the Portage River in the city of Three Rivers."
"1","Portable water purification"
"-1","Neither chlorine (e.g., bleach) nor iodine alone is considered completely effective against 'Cryptosporidium', although they are partially effective against 'Giardia'."
"1","Chlorine is considered slightly better than iodine against 'Giardia'."
"1","A more complete field solution that includes chemical disinfectants is to first filter the water, using a 0.2 micron ceramic cartridge pumped filter, followed by treatment with iodine or chlorine, thereby filtering out cryptosporidium, Giardia, and most bacteria, along with the larger viruses, while also using chemical disinfectant to address smaller viruses and bacteria that the filter cannot remove."
"-1","This combination is also potentially more effective in some cases than even using portable electronic disinfection based on UV treatment, such as using a , that fails to work for other than very clear water."
"1","Portable hole"
"1","In various works of fiction, such as cartoons and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a 'portable hole' is a device that can be used to contravene the laws of physics."
"1","It generally resembles a circular cloth which is placed on a surface to create a hole."
"1","If placed on a wall, for example, the user could crawl through the hole and come out on the other side of the surface."
"1","In another instance, if the hole was placed on the ground, the user might be able to insert objects into it or allow others to fall in, as if he or she had dug a hole."
"1","Port-wine stain"
"1","Port-wine stains occur most often on the face but can appear anywhere on the body."
"1","Early stains are usually flat and pink in appearance."
"1","As the child matures, the color may deepen to a dark red or purplish colour."
"1","In adulthood, thickening of the lesion or the development of small lumps may occur."
"1","Port security"
"1","There are other areas of vulnerability that terrorist may infiltrate."
"1","Exiting trucks may contain WMD or terrorist operatives that are to infiltrate a surrounding metropolitan area, i.e. transporting a chemical explosive device (from the Port of Los Angeles) to a more densely populated area (downtown Los Angeles)."
"1","The disabling of a ship at port is enough to halt all activity at that port for an extended period of time, especially if the disabled ship is blocking a throughway for other vessels."
"1","An example of such an economic impact can be drawn from a labor-management dispute that closed ports along the west coast of the U.S."
"1","These port closures cost the U.S. economy approximately $1 billion dollars per day for the first 5 days, and rose exponentially thereafter."
"1","Port scanner"
"-1","This has resulted in different computer abuse legislation in various countries, as well as different interpretations of those laws."
"1","Although these cases are rare, most of the time the legal process involves proving that an intent to commit a break-in or unauthorized access existed, rather than just the performance of a port scan:"
"1","In June 2003, an Israeli, Avi Mizrahi, was accused by the Israeli Police of the offense of attempting to the unauthorized access of computer material."
"1","The judge even ruled that this kind of actions should not be discouraged when they are performed in a positive way."
"1","A 17-year old Finn was accused of attempted computer break-in by a major Finnish bank."
"1","He performed several port scans on Cherokee County servers to check its security and eventually port scanned a web server monitored by another IT company, provoking a tiff which ended up in a tribunal."
"1","Port multiplier"
"1","Because they believe they are communicating directly with the controller, any drive that holds to the SATA standard can be connected to a port multiplier."
"1","The controller can issue commands to only one disk at a time and cannot issue commands to another disk until the command queue has been completed for the current transactions."
"1","This means that the full bandwidth of the link will most likely not be used."
"1","This kind of switching is therefore used when capacity is the major concern not performance."
"1","Port forwarding"
"1","Port forwarding is commonly done on Unix computers where port numbers numbered below 1024 can only be accessed by software running as the root user."
"-1","Running as root can be a security risk, so some people use port forwarding to redirect incoming traffic from a low numbered port to software listening on a higher port."
"1","For example, a web server may be listening on a port such as 8080 for traffic redirected from the restricted port 80."
"1","A port may be forwarded for use by either the TCP protocol, the UDP protocol, or both."
"1","Port Royal"
"1","Port Royal grew to be one of the two largest towns and the most economically important port in the English colonies."
"1","During a twenty-year period that ended in 1692, nearly 6,500 people lived in Port Royal."
"1","In addition to prostitutes and buccaneers, there were four goldsmiths, forty-four tavern keepers, and a variety of artisans and merchants who lived in 200 buildings crammed into 51 acres (206,000 m2) of real estate. 213 ships visited the seaport in 1688."
"1","The city’s wealth was so great that coins were preferred for payment rather than the more common system of bartering goods for services."
"1","Port River"
"1","There are some mangroves (avicennia marina var resinifera) remaining from the pre-settlement forests along Torrens Island, the north arm of the river and north of the Submarine Corporation near &quot;mutton cove&quot;."
"1","Spring tides are over 21 metres and at low tide mudflats are exposed near the outlet of the river, forming a breeding ground for blue swimmer crabs and other species."
"1","Bottlenose dolphins are often seen in the river, examine and follow small boats and have become a well known tourist attraction with dolphin cruises departing from 'Queens Wharf'."
"1","The industrialised nature of the Port River has led to concern for the welfare of the bottlenose dolphin population and studies have shown that some of the dolphins have very high metal burdens in comparison to dolphins elsewhere."
"1","Port Richmond, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"
"1","Port Richmond, at the beginning of the century, was a working-class neighborhood, and most workers simply walked to their nearby workplaces with lunch pail in hand."
"1","Cars were not common and those who had them stored them in stables."
"-1","Stables for horses and cars were located in various parts of the area."
"-1","Streets – unlike now -—were generally free of parked vehicles, allowing hucksters and other vendors space to easily proceed down the narrow side streets with their horse and wagon on a daily basis."
"1","Port Perry High School"
"-1","The school's music department has been widely recognized as one of the finest in the country."
"1","Its ensembles include Guitar Ensemble, Peapods Blues Revue, 11, and several vocal and instrumental groups."
"1","The 2007-2008 line-up for The Accidentals consisted of John Vaillancourt (Guitar, Lead Vocals, Keyboards), Drew Chester (Guitar, Lead Vocals, Keyboards) Nicole Damoff (Vocals, Lead Guitar), Brian McClean (Lead Guitar) Andrew &quot;Thunderthumbs&quot; Britton (Bass, Backing Vocals), Richard Girvan (Lead Guitar), and Jeremy Foster (Backing Vocals, Violin, Keyboards, Percussion) and the groups director Mr. Gordon &quot;Girv&quot; Girvan."
"-1","In 2008 the school's music department went on tour to Cleveland Ohio and performed at many exciting venues including The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a Cleveland Indians baseball game."
"1","Port Jackson"
"1","The land around Port Jackson was occupied at the time of European discovery and colonisation by various tribes including the Gadigal, Cammeraygal, Eora and Wangal peoples."
"-1","The Gadigal people are said to have occupied the land stretching along the south side of Port Jackson from what is now South Head, in an arc west through to Petersham."
"1","The area along the southern banks of the Parramatta River, west of Petersham to Rose Hill, was reported to belong to the Wanegal."
"1","The Eora people lived on the southern side of the harbour, close to where the First Fleet settled."
"1","Port Eliot"
"-1","The estate office agreed a price, and there began the Elephant Fayre, one of the most eclectic festivals of the 1980s."
"1","The festival ran from 1981-1986, beginning with some 1,500 visitors over four days, and featured a mix of music, theatre and visual arts."
"1","By 1985-6 the festival, like so many of the time, had become victim of its own success."
"1","Despite the tolerance of the then Lord Eliot and fellow festival benefactor Michael Eavis at Glastobury (known affectionately in festival crew parlance as 'The Good Lord and The Worthy Farmer') the travellers put paid, it was said, to the Elephant Fayre and seriously compromised Glastonbury."
"1","Port Arthur massacre (Australia)"
"1","In his police interview Bryant admitted to having car jacked the BMW, but claimed it only had three occupants and denied shooting any person."
"1","He also claimed he did not take the BMW from the vicinity of the toll booth and that his hostage was taken from the BMW."
"1","He also denied visiting Port Arthur on that day, despite identification by several people including the toll attendant."
"1","Bryant also claimed that the guns found by police were not his, but admitted to owning the shotgun that was found with his passport back in his own car near the toll booth."
"1","Porsche 959"
"1","Porsche's head engineer at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one."
"1","Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models."
"1","The motor had originally been developed for the &quot;Moby Dick&quot; race car and then been redeveloped slightly for the short-lived Porsche Indy Car and several other projects before being &quot;tweaked&quot; a last time for use in the 961, the 959's racing counterpart."
"1","The use of sequential twin turbochargers rather than the more usual identical turbochargers for each of the two cylinder banks allowed for smooth seamless delivery of power across the engine RPM band, in contrast to the abrupt on-off power characteristic that distinguished Porsche's other turbocharged engines of the period."
"1","Porphyry of Gaza"
"1","Porphyry of Gaza is known to us only from the vivid biography by Mark the Deacon."
"1","The 'Vita Porphyrii' appears to be a contemporary account of Porphyry that chronicles in some detail the end of paganism in Gaza in the early fifth century."
"1","However the text has been identified in the 20th century as hagiography rather than history and some elements of it are certainly examples of the stereotyped events characteristic of this form of fiction Apparent use of Theodoret and other later sources convinced P. Peeters that it was actually written after 534."
"1","On the other hand the author was certainly intimately familiar with Gaza in late Antiquity instances as history the destruction of the temples in Gaza in 'Vita Porphyrii'., and his statements are of interest at least as reflecting attitudes in the 5th century."
"1","Pornography in Japan"
"1","Magazines are, along with videos, popular media for pornographic materials."
"-1","Many non-pornographic magazines have some glamour photography and as long as women are in something more than a swimsuit, it is considered a non-pornographic photograph."
"-1","Several non-pornographic magazines have some nude photographs of women as a part of their articles but as long as they have an artistic quality and do not show men, it is not considered pornographic."
"1","Furthermore, a female and male doll may be partially clothed or even nude as long as it is a work of art and is not in an act of sex."
"1","Pornography by region"
"1","Other countries commonly visited by American companies involve Colombia and Mexico."
"-1","Magazines or comic books featuring softcore (and some hardcore) pornography are commonly sold in newsstands."
"-1","Several other movies were produced by the European company Private in Costa Rica in the 1990’s."
"-1","The American companies Anabolic and Diabolic produced several Latin based series such as Panochitas, which included trips to places such as the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Chile."
"1","Pornographic film"
"1","The total current income of the country's adult entertainment is often rated at $10–13 billion, of which $4–6 billion are legal."
"1","The figure is often credited to a study by Forrester Research and was lowered in 1998."
"1","Other sources, quoted by Forbes (Adams Media Research, Veronis Suhler Communications Industry Report, and IVD), even taking into consideration all possible means (video networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, web sites, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys, and magazines) mention the $2.6–3.9 billion figure (without the cellphone component)."
"-1","'USA Today' claimed in 2003 that websites such as and generated $2 billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time."
"1","Porno (novel)"
"1","He has also lost some of the charm and physical attractiveness he previously possessed."
"1","Nikki Fuller-Smith - 25-year old university student and film studies major who moonlights performing minor sexual favours at a sauna/massage parlour."
"1","Lauren - Nikki's best friend and flatmate, a feminist, who tries to dissuade Nikki from being in a porn film."
"-1","She is generally regarded as a bore and motherly figure."
"1","Pork rind"
"-1","Pork Scratchings are typically heavy, hard and have a crispy layer of fat under the skin, some still retain the hair of the pig, and are flavored only with salt."
"1","The pig hair is usually removed by quickly burning the skin of the pig before it is cut into pieces and cooked in hot fat."
"-1","Hair removal is not 100% effective which is why some retain a few hairs."
"-1","The hairs sometimes make people question the desirability of these pub snacks."
"1","Porgy and Bess"
"-1","In addition to being influenced by New York jazz and southern black music, many biographers and contemporaries have noted that for many numbers, Gershwin used melodies from Jewish liturgical music."
"1","Gershwin biographer Edward Jablonski has claimed that the melody to &quot;It Ain't Necessarily So&quot; was taken from the Haftarah blessing, and others have attributed it to the Torah blessing."
"-1","Allusions to Jewish music have been detected by other observers as well."
"1","Porcupine Tree"
"1","Porcupine Tree is notable for being an album-oriented band, making very conceptual records where many songs are related to each other."
"1","I don't like the idea of any song sounding like any other song."
"1","So most of the time it's a case of finding the sound world first whether it be a texture or a drum rhythm that sets you off on a certain musical path, or particular musical atmosphere, or flavor.&quot;"
"1","For their records, the band include mellotron, hammered dulcimer and guimbri among other unusual instruments for rock bands."
"1","Porcupine Gold Rush"
"1","They staked twelve claims near their discovery and then, because different sponsors had staked them food money, they flipped a coin to determine how to divide the claims."
"1","Hollinger won the toss and chose the six claims on the west."
"-1","Noah A. Timmins, a former storekeeper in Mattawa and the owner of the LaRose silver mine in Cobalt, purchased Benny Hollinger's claims and opened the Hollinger Mine, one of the greatest gold-producers in the western hemisphere."
"1","Noah's nephew, Alphonse Paré, described it: “It was as if a giant cauldron had splattered the gold nuggets over a bed of pure white quartz crystals as a setting for some magnificent crown jewels of inestimable value.”"
"1","Porchetta"
"1","Although popular in the whole country, porchetta originated in central Italy, with Ariccia (in the Province of Rome) being the town most closely associated with it."
"1","Elsewhere, it is considered a celebratory dish."
"1","Across Italy is usually sold by pitchmen with their typically white-painted vans, especially during public displays or holidays, and it can be served in a panino."
"1","It is also eaten as a meat dish in many households or as part of a picnic."
"1","Porch"
"-1","There are various styles of porches, all of which depend on the architectural tradition of its location."
"1","However, they may be larger."
"1","Verandahs, for example, are usually quite large and may encompass the entire facade as well as the sides of a structure."
"1","At the other extreme, the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Michigan has the longest porch in the world at in length."
"1","Populous: The Beginning"
"-1","The player commands several different types of followers, each of which has advantages and disadvantages in combat."
"1","The most basic unit is the Brave, which builds houses, towers, and military buildings."
"1","Warriors are the most basic military unit, employing a melee attack."
"1","The Shaman herself is fairly weak, although she can be resurrected indefinitely during gameplay."
"1","Shamans make up for their weakness with a number of spells, which can be used in offensive or defensive situations."
"1","Population transfer in the Soviet Union"
"-1","At the same time, on a number of occasions the workforce was transferred by non-violent means, usually by means of &quot;recruitment&quot; ('????????')."
"-1","This kind of recruitment was regularly performed at forced settlements, where people were naturally more willing to resettle."
"-1","For example, the workforce of the Donbass and Kuzbass mining basins is known to have been replenished in this way."
"-1","(As a note of historical comparison, in Imperial Russia the mining workers at state mines ('bergals', &quot;???????&quot;, from German 'Bergauer') were often recruited in lieu of military service which, for a certain period, had a term of 25 years )."
"1","Population transfer"
"1","In the nineteenth century, the United States government removed a number of Native American nations to federally owned and designated Indian reservations."
"1","Starting in the 1830s with the Choctaw people, the policy known as Indian removal relocated many nations living east of the Mississippi River to the Indian Territory in the west, a process that resulted in the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; for the Cherokees."
"1","Resistance to Indian removal led to several violent conflicts, including the Second Seminole War in Florida."
"1","Later in the century, the establishment of reservations for the Plains Indians led to numerous Indian Wars."
"1","Population history of American indigenous peoples"
"1","Stannard's claim of 100 million deaths has been disputed because he does not cite any demographic data to support this number, and because he makes no distinction between death from violence and death from disease."
"1","Noble David Cook, Latin Americanist and history professor at Florida International University, considers books such as Stannard's a number of which were released around the year 1992 to coincide with the 500th anniversary of the Columbus voyage to America to be an unproductive return to Black Legend-type explanations for depopulation."
"1","In response to Stannard's figure, political scientist R. J. Rummel has instead estimated that over the centuries of European colonization about 2 million to 15 million American indigenous people were the victims of what he calls 'democide.'"
"-1","Rummel's estimate is presumably not a single democide, but a total of multiple democides, since there were many different governments involved."
"1","Population history of American indigenous peoples"
"-1","One reason this death toll was overlooked (or downplayed) is that, once introduced, diseases raced ahead of European immigration in many areas."
"-1","After the epidemics had already killed massive numbers of natives, many newer European immigrants assumed that there had always been relatively few indigenous peoples."
"-1","The scope of the epidemics over the years was vast, killing millions of people—possibly in excess of 90% of the population in the hardest hit areas—and creating one of &quot;the greatest human catastrophe in history, far exceeding even the disaster of the Black Death of medieval Europe that killed up to one-third of the people in Europe and Asia between 1347 and 1351."
"1","Population history of American indigenous peoples"
"1","In populations where a disease is endemic, most adults are exposed to the disease at a young age."
"-1","With proper care, many of these &quot;childhood diseases&quot; are often survivable."
"1","In a naive population, all age groups are affected at once, leaving few or no healthy caregivers to nurse the sick."
"1","With no resistant individuals healthy enough to tend to the ill, a disease may have higher fatalities than otherwise."
"1","Population decline"
"1","It does not relate to carrying capacity, and is not a term in opposition to overpopulation, which deals with the total possible population that can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure."
"1","&quot;Underpopulation&quot; is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system."
"-1","Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic term employed to imply that the transfer payment schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point."
"1","In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generation."
"1","Population control"
"1","His central argument on population is as follows: A cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells; the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people."
"1","Treating only the symptoms of cancer may make the victim more comfortable at first, but eventually he dies - often horribly."
"-1","The operation will demand many apparent brutal and heartless decisions."
"1","The pain may be intense."
"1","Popular revolt in late medieval Europe"
"1","Finally, layered on top of this was a popular ideological view of the time that property, wealth and inequality was against the teachings of God, as expressed through the teachings of the Franciscans."
"-1","The sentiment of the time was probably best expressed by preacher John Ball during the English Peasant Revolt when he said &quot;When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?&quot;."
"1","In other words, &quot;gentleman&quot; are nobles, all men are equal before God."
"1","It was a cry for a leveling of society where no man is above any other."
"1","Popular print"
"1","In the 1400s the great majority of these images were religious, if playing cards are excluded."
"1","Most were coloured, usually crudely, by hand or later by stencil."
"-1","One political cartoon relating to events in 1468-70 has survived in several different versions (many from years later)."
"1","Old master print is a term that at this period includes popular prints, but later is restricted to more expensive and purely artistic prints."
"1","Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"
"1","The concert was broadcast worldwide including SFR Yugoslavia."
"-1","Beside &quot;Do They Know it's Christmas?&quot; and USA for Africa projects from the UK and USA respectively, plenty of other countries also joined in."
"1","The group included Oliver Mandić, Željko Bebek, Momčilo Bajagić, Slađana Milošević, Jura Stublić, Dado Topić, Zdravko Čolić, Izolda Barudžija, Snežana Mišković, Alen Islamović, Sead Lipovača, Dejan Cukić, Doris Dragović, Anja Rupel, Srđan Šaper, Vladimir Divljan, Peđa D' Boy, Zoran Predin and other eminent musicians."
"-1","The video for &quot;Za million godina&quot; was played on many TV stations worldwide and also, on July 13 at the Wembley Stadium on large video screens during a video interlude."
"1","Popular education"
"1","Such popular educations were also a major feature of May '68 and of the following decenie, leading in particular to the establishment of the University of Paris VIII - Vincennes in Paris, in 1969."
"1","Famous intellectuals such as Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan and others held seminars there, in full classrooms where no seats could be found."
"1","For instance, musicians such as Richard Pinhas assisted at Deleuze's courses, and after having written the 'Anti-Oedipus' (1972) with Félix Guattari, Deleuze used to say that non-specialists had best understood their work."
"1","Furthermore, Vincennes had no amphitheatres, representatives of the 'mandarin' teacher facing and dominating by his position several hundreds students silenciously taking notes."
"1","Popular culture studies"
"-1","The question whether popular culture or mass culture is inherently conservative, or whether it can be used in a subversive strategy as well, is equally hotly debated."
"-1","It seems widely accepted that popular culture forms can function at any moment as anti-cultures."
"1","&quot;Bad taste&quot; products such as pornography and horror fiction, says for instance Andrew Ross (1989:231), draw their popular appeal precisely from their expressions of disrespect for the imposed lessons of educated taste."
"-1","They are expressions of social resentment on the part of groups which have been subordinated and excluded by today's &quot;civilized society&quot;."
"1","Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command"
"1","In the 1970s and 1980s, the group carried out a number of attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, and gained notoriety for using spectacular means."
"-1","He killed six soldiers and wounded several others, before being shot dead himself."
"-1","The action has been seen by some as providing the catalyst for the eruption of the First Intifada."
"1","The PFLP-GC has not been involved in major attacks on Israeli targets since the early 1990s, but it has reportedly cooperated with the Hezbollah guerrillas in South Lebanon."
"1","Poppy tea"
"1","Effects vary widely depending on dosage (amount of poppy straw used, alkaloid content of poppies and the quality of extraction), on individual sensitivity and on any opiate tolerance which has built up."
"1","Since many of the opioid receptors are located in the spinal chord (CNC) as well as in the digestive tract, the user describes the ability to feel the intestinal tract with the sensation of lightness, and pleasure."
"-1","Additionally, some users report a sensation of light pressure on the back of the neck."
"1","Since opioids are known to release histamine, the user may become itchy as the liver starts to metabolize the alkaloids."
"1","Poppy seed"
"1","Fillings in pastries are usually made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar."
"1","The ground filling is used in poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added."
"1","For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted."
"1","The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely and freshly ground because this will make a big difference in the pastry fillings texture and taste."
"1","Poppy"
"1","However, according to an article published in the 'Medical Science Law Journal', after ingesting &quot;a curry meal or two containing various amounts of washed seeds&quot; where total morphine levels were in the range 58.4 to 62.2 µg/g seeds, the urinary morphine levels were found to range as high as 1.27 µg/mL (1,270 ng/mL) urine."
"1","Another article in the 'Journal of Forensic Science' reports that concentration of morphine in some batches of seeds may be as high as 251 µg/g."
"1","In both studies codeine was also present in the seeds in smaller concentrations."
"1","Therefore it is possible to cross the current standard 2,000 ng/mL limit of detection, depending on seed potency and quantity ingested."
"1","Poppers"
"1","Several researchers have demonstrated a statistical correlation between popper use and HHV-8-infection and development of Kaposi's Sarcoma."
"1","However the most recently published peer-reviewed English-language overview of research on the health risks of poppers notes a lack of controlled trials."
"-1","The correlation might therefore be accounted for by a bias among some popper users towards high-risk sexual behaviours."
"1","Anal sex was also correlated."
"1","However, a meta review of 30 research articles examining HIV infection risk and club drug use showed some evidence for poppers being a risk factor for HIV infection but considered further research was necessary."
"1","Popotan"
"1","Most of 'Popotan's gameplay requires little interaction from the player since a majority of the time is spent reading the text that appears on the game's screen, which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist."
"1","Gameplay pauses at these points and, depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress and may branch off in a specific direction, though pursuing anyone beyond the three sisters requires at least one of the latter's scenarios to have been successfully completed."
"-1","The PS2 port added new events and scenes based on the DVD version, although some of the content that was removed."
"1","This allows the player to play the mini-game based upon various music tracks from the game."
"1","Popoluca"
"1","The name however stuck to many languages and has caused some confusion even among linguists working with Native American languages."
"1","This confusion prompted some kind of distinction between Popoluca languages and the spelling &quot;Popoluca&quot; with an &quot;u&quot; became used for certain Mixe-Zoquean languages, while the spelling &quot;Popoloca&quot; with an &quot;o&quot; became used for certain languages of the Popolocan family of Oto-Manguean languages."
"-1","Some indigenous communities speaking languages called Popoluca feel that this name is unfairly given and carries a derogatory meaning and they prefer other names to be used about them."
"-1","Below is a list of different varieties of Popoluca and Popoloca and the alternative names that are now beginning to be used for them, at least in some technical and governmental publications."
"1","Poplar River First Nation"
"1","More importantly, in more recent decades the sudden change to mainstream diet could also have negative side-effects, not just with members of this community, but for all First Nation people; on or off reserve."
"1","The introduction of additives to foods such as hormones, antibiotics, tranquilizers, excessively high sugar, salt, and other additives, and even caffeine, nicotine and alcohol, could cause chemical changes in the bodies of First Nation people interfering with mental wellness."
"1","This would explain the high incidents of alcoholism, higher than average rates of suicide, as well as other social ills."
"1","There have been no in-depth scientific studies or analysis in to this particular area specifically targeted at the First Nation peoples."
"1","Popex"
"1","The real-time price fluctuations of the artists were shown in the 'control panel' and also by numerous charts on the individual artists' pages."
"1","24hr summaries of the biggest risers and fallers were shown on the (largely redundant but highly popular) shakers and movers (S&amp;M) chart."
"1","The best 40 players were recorded in the 'rich-list' on the comprehensive stats pages."
"1","Occasionally prizes like compact discs and shirts were given out to those who performed best."
"1","As of June, 2005, over 150,000 people belonged to the site, which was based in London, United Kingdom."
"1","Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria"
"1","To guide the various dioceses under his jurisdiction to nominate the candidates for episcopal shepherding, and thus consecrate the Hierarchs for these eparchies."
"1","To consecrate bishops for various dioceses or bishoprics, to elevate bishops to the metropolitan dignity and to consecrate and enthrone Patriarchs for daughter autonomous or autocephalous churches of the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria."
"1","To promulgate missions to preach Christianity to various parts of the world."
"1","There are Coptic Orthodox Churches worldwide in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, England, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Belgium, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Greece, Brazil, Bolivia and other nations."
"1","Pope Urban I"
"-1","It had been believed that he was buried in the 'Coemetarium Praetextati' where a tomb was inscribed with his name."
"1","De Rossi therefore concluded that the Urban buried in the Coemetarium Praetextati was another bishop and Pope Urban was located in St. Callistus' Catacomb."
"-1","While many historians accept this belief doubt remains."
"-1","Therefore it is possible that Pope Urban is indeed buried in the Coemetarium Praetextati."
"1","Pope Sergius IV"
"1","The power held by Sergius IV was often overshadowed by Crescentius III, the ruler of the city of Rome at the time."
"-1","Some historians have claimed that Sergius IV was essentially a puppet ruler for Crescentius III."
"-1","Others, however, claimed that the Pope resisted Crescentius III's power."
"-1","There is some evidence that Sergius IV gave political backing to an anti-Crescentius faction in the city."
"1","Pope Pius XII"
"-1","For example, Pinchas Lapide, a Jewish theologian and Israeli diplomat to Milan in the 1960s, estimated controversially in 'Three Popes and the Jews' that Pius &quot;was instrumental in saving at least 700,000 but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands.&quot;"
"-1","some historians have questioned this oft-cited number, which Lapide reached by &quot;deducting all reasonable claims of rescue&quot; by non-Catholics from the total number of European Jews surviving the Holocaust."
"1","Catholic scholar Kevin Madigan interprets this and other praise from prominent Jewish leaders, including Golda Meir, as less than sincere, an attempt to secure Vatican recognition of the State of Israel."
"1","Pope Pius XII"
"1","Cornwell's work was the first to have access to testimonies from Pius's beatification process as well as to many documents from Pacelli's nunciature which had just been opened under the seventy-five year rule by the Vatican State Secretary archives."
"1","Much praise of Cornwell centered around his disputed claim that he was a practising Catholic who had attempted to absolve Pius with his work."
"1","While works such as Susan Zuccotti's 'Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy' (2000) and Michael Phayer's 'The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965' (2000) are critical of both Cornwell and Pius XII, Ronald J. Rychlak's 'Hitler, the War and the Pope' is critical as well but defends Pius XII in light of his access to most recent documents."
"1","Cornwell's scholarship has been criticized."
"1","For example, Kenneth L. Woodward stated in his review in 'Newsweek' that &quot;errors of fact and ignorance of context appear on almost every page.&quot;"
"1","Pope Pius IX"
"-1","The Pope went several times to the balcony to give his blessing."
"-1","Following this the Quirinal was covered by canon fire, which caused several deaths."
"1","The very last papal shot at the Porta Pia was fired by an Jesuit Austrian alumnus of the Stella Matutina (Jesuit School)"
"1","Pius IX was lampooned by reference to the Italian version of his name ('Pio Nono'), as 'Pio No No'."
"1","His occasional mood changes and emotional outbursts have been interpreted as symptoms of his epilepsy."
"1","One enduring popular touch lies in Pius IX's artistic legacy as author of the Italian-language lyrics of Italy's best known indigenous Christmas carol, 'Tu scendi dalle stelle' (&quot;From starry skies descended&quot;), originally a Neapolitan language song written by Saint Alphonsus Liguori."
"1","During his stay at the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, on 8 September 1849, Pope Pius IX had the experience of a train trip from Portici to Pagani, so he became enthusiastic about this modern invention."
"1","The houses along the streets were illuminated with torches, and people threw flowers from the window on the horse-drawn carriage."
"1","Pope Pius IX"
"1","Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors."
"1","The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal censorship."
"1","He generously supported all expressions of art, architecture, painting,sculpture,music, goldsmiths, coppersmiths and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives."
"-1","Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved."
"1","Saint Peter's Basilica got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza."
"1","Pope Pius IX"
"-1","His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title &quot;king&quot;."
"-1","One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his infallibility dogma, Ignaz Döllinger, considered the 'political regime' of the pope in the Papal States 'as wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations.'"
"1","In the period before the 1848 revolution, Pius IX was a most ardent reformer."
"1","After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above"
"1","Pope Pius IX"
"1","He celebrated several jubilees such as the 300th anniversary of the Council of Trent, and his own Golden Jubilee in 1868."
"1","The Italian government, intervening in Church affairs, had outlawed in 1870 a number of popular pilgrimages."
"1","At the 50th anniversary of his Episcopal consecration, people from all parts of the world came to see the old pontiff from 30 April 1877 to 15 June 1877."
"-1","The Pope was a bit shy on himself, but he valued initiative within the Church and created several new titles, rewards and orders to elevate those, who in his view deserved merit for their Church engagement."
"1","Pope Pius II"
"-1","Pius II was a versatile and voluminous author, one of the best and most industrious of his period."
"1","His most important and longest work is his autobiography 'Commentaries' in 13 books, first published in 1584 by Cardinal Francesco Bandini Piccolomini, a distant relative."
"1","Piccolomini altered it to some extent, removing words, phrases and whole passages that were unflattering to his relative."
"1","Pius II was also the author of numerous erotic poems and an obscene comedy titled 'Chrysis' (such ethics were not unusual for his period)."
"1","Pope Paul VI"
"-1","This encyclical was written in the wake of Vatican II, when the Catholic Church was questioning and revising many long-held practices."
"-1","Priestly celibacy is considered a discipline rather than dogma, and some at the time had expected that it might be relaxed."
"1","The encyclical Sacerdotalis Caelibatus from 24 June 1967, confirms the traditional Church teaching, that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Roman Catholic priests."
"1","However, during his pontificate Paul VI was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicization of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state, a position which was drastically reversed by John Paul II in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 Canon Law that only the pope himself can in exceptional circumstances grant laicization."
"1","Pope Leo XIII"
"1","Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that &quot;is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man&quot; Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise, that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler."
"1","He opposed notions of marriage as a commercial contract, divorce, and education without religion, a State without God."
"1","He rejected some forms of egalitarianism: &quot;People differ in capacity, skill, health, strength; and unequal fortune is a necessary result of unequal condition."
"1","All men are equal in regard to their common origin and nature, or the last end which each one has to attain, or the rights and duties which are thence derived."
"1","Leo XIII predicts that if state authorities do not heed these eternal truths, if they permit &quot;the fear of God and reverence for divine laws being taken away&quot;, overthrow of the existing order and of the authorities themselves will occur."
"1","Attempts are under way, he claims, by communists, socialists and Freemasons."
"1","But, whoever strive against the order which Divine Providence has constituted pay usually the penalty of their pride, and meet with affliction and misery where they rashly hoped to find all things prosperous and in conformity with their desires."
"1","Obedience to God is a teaching which supports civil authorities, because Church teaching about the divine origin of authority civil authority, and fosters obedience to it."
"1","Pope Julius II"
"1","Despite an illegitimate daughter, rumors also surrounded Julius about his sexuality."
"-1","Casting himself in the role of a warrior, inevitably created enemies for Julius - many of whom accused him of being a sodomite."
"-1","This was almost certainly done in order to discredit him but perhaps, in doing so, accusers were attacking a perceived weak point in their adversary's character."
"-1","Venetians - who were opposed to the pope's new militarstic policy - were amongst the most vocal."
"1","Pope John Paul II"
"1","He was one of the most-travelled world leaders in history, visiting 129 countries during his pontificate."
"1","He was fluent in many languages: his native Polish as well as Italian, French, German, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Croatian, Ancient Greek and Latin."
"1","As part of his special emphasis on the universal call to holiness, he beatified 1,340 people and canonised 483 Saints, more than the combined tally of his predecessors during the last five centuries.'"
"-1","Whether John Paul II canonised more saints than all previous popes put together is difficult to prove, as the records of many early canonisations are incomplete, missing, or inaccurate.'"
"1","Pope Benedict XVI and Islam"
"1","On July 21, 2006, Pope Benedict XVI that he does not plan to intervene diplomatically in the Middle East fighting, but called on people of all religions to join Sunday's worldwide day of prayers for peace."
"1","&quot;I think it is best to leave that to the diplomats, because we don't enter politics."
"1","Our goal is simply peace, and we will do everything to help attain peace,&quot; Benedict told reporters as he returned from an hour-long hike in the Italian Alps."
"1","The pope has set aside Sunday as a worldwide day of prayers for peace, hoping the prayers will bring a halt to the fighting."
"1","We will help with our prayers and with the people we have in ... in Lebanon&quot;."
"1","Pope Benedict XII"
"1","He spent most of his time working on questions of theology."
"-1","He rejected many of the ideas developed by John XXII."
"-1","Though some claim that he campaigned against the Immaculate Conception, this is far from clear."
"1","He engaged in long theological debates with other noted figures of the age such as William of Ockham and Meister Eckhart."
"1","Pope Alexander VI"
"1","A danger now arose in the shape of a conspiracy on the part of the deposed despots, the Orsini, and of some of Cesare's own condottieri."
"1","His goods were confiscated, his aged mother turned into the street and many other members of the clan in Rome were arrested, while Giuffre Borgia led an expedition into the Campagna and seized their castles."
"1","Thus the two great houses of Orsini and Colonna, who had long fought for predominance in Rome and often flouted the Pope's authority, were subjugated and the Borgias' power increased."
"1","Cesare then returned to Rome, where his father asked him to assist Giuffre in reducing the last Orsini strongholds; this for some reason he was unwilling to do, much to Alexander VI's annoyance; but he eventually marched out, captured Ceri and made peace with Giulio Orsini, who surrendered Bracciano."
"1","PopMart Tour"
"1","The link-ups were arranged by aid worker Bill Carter, who interviewed ordinary people about their experiences of the ongoing War in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"1","The Sarajevo show had to wait until the PopMart Tour, when U2 became the first major band to perform in the city after the war had ended."
"1","The highly emotional concert was among the highlights of the PopMart Tour."
"1","50,000 people attended and effort was made to make sure all the ethnic groups were present."
"1","Also in attendance were several hundred members of the international &quot;Stabilisation Force&quot; (SFOR) who were tasked at that time with upholding the Dayton Agreement."
"1","Pop-up ad"
"1","Certain types of downloaded content, such as images, free music, and others, can cause pop ups, especially pornographic sites' pop ups."
"1","However, some will reload the page, causing loss of any information that had been entered."
"-1","On many internet browsers, holding down the ctrl key while clicking a link will allow it to bypass the popup filter."
"1","Clicking (even accidentally) on one pop-up may lead to other pop-up ads opening, especially pornographic pop-ups."
"1","Pop-up ad"
"1","As pop-up ads became widespread, many users learned to immediately close the popup ads that appeared over a site without looking at them."
"1","Pop-under ads do not immediately impede a user's ability to view the site content, and thus usually remain unnoticed until the main browser window is closed, leaving the user's attention free for the advertisement."
"1","Pop-under ads were first introduced by ExitExchange corporation in 1999."
"1","After years of controversy and numerous articles on the pop-under patent (see references), the patent was awarded by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in April and June of 2008."
"1","Although the pop-under ad is ubiquitous with annoying methodologies it still is used by major publishers such as CNN.com and Wall Street Journal."
"1","Pop rock"
"1","As with many musical genres, what constitutes &quot;pop rock&quot; is subjective."
"-1","As such, music critics and journalists have differing opinions on which category a band should be placed in."
"1","'Billboard' magazine provides one perspective on how to categorize &quot;pop rock&quot; groups from the 1970s to the 2000s."
"-1","Other perspectives from other magazines and individual music journalists and critics are also provided."
"1","Pop Idol"
"1","The Saturday night primetime show initially followed the audition process, as hopefuls sang before four judges (record producer and music executive Pete Waterman, music executive and music manager Simon Cowell, music promoter and music manager Nicki Chapman and Radio DJ and television personality Neil &quot;Dr&quot; Fox) at various locations around the UK."
"1","Besides the successful auditionees, the poorest &quot;singers&quot; were often aired due to their obvious lack of talent or presence."
"1","Poor singers often faced harsh criticisms from the judges, especially from Simon Cowell (whose controversial rantings also made him famous on 'American Idol')."
"1","The judges' reactions to such performances often ranged from disgust to nearly open laughter; their style of judgement and attitude towards pop-star wannabes resulted in the controversial opinions of others about the show's setup, including that of Take That manager, Nigel Martin Smith."
"1","Poor Man's Bible"
"1","Other churches have been founded by or have been associated with some person who was later canonised."
"1","These associations are often celebrated in the decoration of the church, to encourage worshippers to emulate the piety, good works, or steadfast faith of the saint."
"1","Sometimes saints are shown together in a sort of pictorial gallery, but the depiction of narratives is also common."
"1","This may take the form of a single incident, such as Saint Sebastian tied to a tree and bristling with arrows or St Christopher carrying the Christ Child across the river, or the saint's life may be shown in a narrative sequence, similar to the way in which the life of Jesus is depicted."
"1","Poondi Kumaraswamy"
"1","During the period of Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship he created the first comprehensive 20 volume hydrological atlas of Tamil Nadu State of India including mathematical models, details of hydraulic structures, among others."
"1","He developed also the double bounded probability density function (Kumaraswamy distribution), a probability density function suitable for physical variables that are usually bounded."
"1","He worked also as a design and construction engineer of two major industrial works, namely, the Tiruchirappalli Boiler Plant, and the Tuticorin Harbour Project."
"1","In addition he was involved in the hydraulic design of numerous dams, canals, and other hydraulic structures throughout South India."
"1","Poole Harbour"
"1","Continuing anti-clockwise, now heading south are the majority of the islands within the Harbour as well as several small channels and inlets."
"1","The majority of land in this area is heathland and there are few settlements, as opposed to western part of the Harbour."
"1","Green Island, Furzey Island and Brownsea Island (in that order) are to the east, with Newton Bay and Brands Bay (this area has several oil wells) to the south."
"1","This area of water is known as the South Deep."
"1","Poole"
"1","The district is overwhelmingly populated by people of a white ethnic background, 95.98% of residents are of White British ethnicity, well above the rest of England at 86.99%."
"1","Minority ethnic groups (including those in white ethnic groups who did not classify themselves as British) represent 4.0% of Poole’s population."
"1","The largest religion in Poole is Christianity, at almost 74.34%, slightly above the United Kingdom average of 71.6%."
"1","The next-largest sector is those with no religion, at almost 16.23%, also above the UK average of 15.5%."
"1","Poole"
"1","Parkstone Grammar School was the most successful secondary school in Poole for GCSE results in 2007: 100% of pupils gained five or more GCSEs at A"
"1","to C grade including maths and English."
"1","Canford School also achieved 100% and Poole Grammar School was the next best performing school with 98%."
"1","Poole’s grammar schools were also the best performing for A-level results."
"1","Poole Grammar School was the 60th most successful school/sixth form in the country in 2007: each student achieved on average 1071.4 points compared to the national average of 731.2."
"1","Pool-type reactor"
"1","However most often 19.75% enrichment is used, falling just under the 20% level that would make it highly enriched."
"1","Fuel elements may be plates or rods with 8.5% to 45% uranium."
"1","Beryllium and graphite blocks or plates may be added to the core as neutron reflectors and neutron absorbing rods pierce the core for control."
"1","General Atomics of La Jolla, CA manufactures TRIGA reactor fuel elements in France for the majority of these types of reactors around the world."
"1","Pool of Siloam"
"1","As a freshwater reservoir, it would have been a major gathering place for ancient Jews making religious pilgrimages to the city."
"-1","The Gospel of John suggests that it was probably used as a mikvah (ritual bath), although mikvah are usually much smaller in size; if the pool were a mikvah, it would be the largest ever found, by a substantial margin, and mentioned in Byzantine works such as the 7th century 'Chronicon Paschale'; other nymphaeum built by Hadrian, such as that at Sagalassos, have a very similar appearancefor example, see ."
"-1","Although most Christian scholars date the Gospel of John to the end of the first century, dates as late as the 140s have been suggested; the latter date range would imply that the description in the Gospel of John was written after Hadrian had built the Nymphaeum."
"1","Pool of Bethesda"
"1","The Johannine narrative describes the porticos as being a place in which large numbers of infirm people were waiting, (a) which corresponds well with the site's first century use as an asclepieion."
"-1","Some ancient biblical manuscripts argue that these people were waiting for the 'troubling of the water'; (b) a few such manuscripts also move the setting away from Roman rituals into something more appropriate to Judaism, by adding that an angel would occasionally stir the waters, which would then cure the first person to enter."
"-1","Although the Vulgate does not include the 'troubling of the water' or the 'angel tradition', these were present in many of the manuscripts used by early English translations of the Bible, who therefore included it in their translations."
"1","Modern textual scholarship views these extra details as unreliable and unlikely to have been part of the original text; many modern translations do not include the 'troubling of the water' or the 'angel tradition', but leave the earlier numbering system, so that they skip from verse '3a' straight to verse '5'."
"1","Pontifical High Mass"
"1","In the early Church, Mass was normally celebrated by the bishop, with other clergy."
"1","In the Roman Rite this evolved into a form of Solemn High Mass celebrated by a bishop accompanied by a deacon, subdeacon, thurifer, acolyte(s) and other ministers, under the guidance of a priest acting as Master of Ceremonies."
"1","Most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests."
"1","The parts to be said aloud are all chanted, except that the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, which before the reform of Pope Pius V were said in the sacristy or during the entrance procession, were said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon, while the choir sang the Introit."
"1","Pontiac's Rebellion"
"1","He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, within striking distance of a number of native villages."
"1","Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Natives were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace."
"1","Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families."
"1","Because not all of the captives were present, the Natives were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned."
"1","Pontiac Grand Prix"
"1","The base Model J underwent a number of content changes to cut the base price by around $500 to be more competitive with other mid-sized personal luxury cars."
"1","Those changes for the &quot;J&quot; included a smaller 350 CID V8 as the base powerplant and some downgrading of interior trim that included a new notchback bench seat made standard equipment and the Strato bucket seats/console moved to the &quot;option&quot; list."
"1","Leather interior trim was a new extra-cost option available with the Strato bucket seats and LJ and SJ models."
"1","Both the &quot;LJ&quot; and &quot;SJ&quot; models came standard with a 400 CID V8 that was optional on the Model J. The 455 CID V8 was optional on all models."
"1","In celebration of Pontiac's 50th anniversary in 1976, a number of special edition Grand Prix painted gold were produced."
"1","These models featured removable Hurst T-tops, Rally II wheels and other distinctions but were mechanically similar to the regular models."
"1","Pontiac can Am"
"1","There have been some pervasive myths or urban legends regarding the Can Am."
"1","It was only available in Cameo White paint, and not any other color from the factory - such as Mandarin Orange or Carousel Red."
"1","This rumor continues, despite the facts being well documented via discussions with Jim Wangers, the motivating force behind Motortown."
"1","Road tests commonly quoted the Can Am as having a Pontiac 400, along with a 2.41 rear gear ratio."
"1","However, one Can Am has been restored and modified with a conversion to a Super T10 manual transmission using all-GM factory parts, from various years of the 73-77 GM A-body."
"1","Pong"
"1","Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was not interested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings."
"1","Upon hearing this, the two groups declined Bushnell's offer."
"1","The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing."
"1","By 1973, they began shipping 'Pong' to other countries with the aid of foreign partners."
"1","Pond hockey"
"-1","There are many Pond hockey tournaments in the United States and Canada."
"1","There is no skill level bias in these tournaments, everyone is eligible to sign up, however due to popular demand signing up early becomes very essential."
"-1","The tournaments have been covered by many news stations they have also been headlines on many newspapers."
"1","The tournaments may have rules but are still purposed for enjoyment."
"1","Pond hockey"
"1","Organized outdoor hockey has been played many years before indoor rinks were popularized."
"1","Then a bird came to the stranger and said, that if he were to hit the ball lightly the bird would take the ball across the line (commonly known as a goal)."
"1","Shinny was not just a part of Navajo culture it was part of many Indian stories."
"1","Shinny was also used to praise gods, and people would play in honor of a certain god."
"1","Shinny was played by almost all tribes, women were also allowed to play, sometimes they would even play with or against men of the tribe."
"1","Some balls were made from a knot in a tree, some were made of whale bone, others where made of buffalo hair covered with the skin of a buck."
"-1","It is said that some tribes in North Dakota could not accept losing and would kill anyone who beat them."
"1","They were usually as big as the land could suffice for, they also corresponded to the number of players."
"1","Pompeo Marchesi"
"-1","The greater part of his life was spent in Milan, where for many years he was professor of sculpture at the Academy."
"1","He executed a large number of groups in marble and portrait busts."
"1","For the Arco della Pace (commemorative arch now in the Parco Sempione), completed in 1838, he made various reliefs including of Terpsichore and Venus Urania, and of the rivers Adige and Tagliamento."
"-1","One of his best-known compositions is the group of the &quot;Mater Dolorosa&quot;, in the church of San Carlo, at which he worked for many years."
"1","Pomesanians"
"1","In 1243, the Bishopric of Pomesania and the other three dioceses (Bishopric of Samland, Ermland, and Bishopric of Culm) were put under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Riga by papal legate William of Modena."
"1","Pomesanians joined the other Prussian clans during the First Prussian Uprising (1242–1249), but was the only clan not to participate in the Great Prussian Uprising (1260–1274)."
"1","As the westernmost Prussian territory, it was the most exposed clan to German colonists and their culture."
"1","They assimilated and became extinct a bit faster than the other Prussians."
"1","Pomegranate"
"1","Pomegranates are a motif often found in Christian religious decoration."
"1","They are often woven into the fabric of vestments and liturgical hangings or wrought in metalwork."
"1","Pomegranates figure in many religious paintings by the likes of Sandro Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci, often in the hands of the Virgin Mary or the infant Jesus."
"1","In the Eastern Orthodox Church, pomegranate seeds may be used in kolyva, a dish prepared for memorial services, as a symbol of the sweetness of the heavenly kingdom."
"1","Pomegranate"
"-1","It is the official logo of many cities in Turkey."
"-1","Although not native to China, Korea or Japan, the pomegranate is widely grown there and many cultivars have been developed."
"-1","It is widely used for bonsai because of its flowers and for the unusual twisted bark that older specimens can attain."
"1","Balaustines, the red rose-like flowers of the pomegranate, taste bitter and may be used as an astringent in folk medicine."
"1","Pomade"
"-1","Most pomades contain petroleum jelly (in fact, petroleum jelly can be used alone as a pomade) and mineral oil, and many also contain some sort of wax."
"1","They may be anhydrous or emulsified with an aqueous carrier, which makes them easier to remove."
"1","They may also contain perfume and coloring agents."
"1","The stiffest will have a higher proportion of beeswax while the lightest may have a higher proportion of oils."
"1","Pom-pon"
"1","Cheerleading pom-pons come in a variety of shapes, styles, colors, color combinations and sizes."
"-1","Of particular note is the emerging variation in handles used by many manufacturers."
"1","Metallic (shiny) poms have become very popular in recent years, as have more cost-effective look-alike poms that are often given to spectators at sporting events."
"1","These spectator poms are often called Rooter or Spirit poms."
"1","Polywell"
"1","The polywell differs from the fusor in that the electrons are magnetically confined, so that it is also related to magnetic confinement fusion, most closely to magnetic mirrors."
"1","In common with magnetic mirrors is the field minimum in the central region, the confinement (in part) by the mirror effect, and (at least to some extent) a non-thermal distribution of the electron energies."
"-1","In some mirror configurations, the field in the center is a minimum in every direction, as it is in the central region of a polywell."
"1","The magnetic field in such a case is said to have &quot;good curvature&quot; because a certain class of fluctuations are stable in a plasma contained by such a field."
"1","Polytrichum commune"
"1","While mosses are considered non-vascular plants, 'Polytrichum commune' shows clear differentiation of water conducting tissue."
"1","The other tissue is called 'leptom', which surround the hadrom and contains smaller cells."
"1","This tissue is, on the other hand, analogous to phloem."
"1","When these two tissue types are taken into account along with the species' exceptional height, it becomes clear that common haircap moss is quite a unique moss considering that the majority of species show little differentiation of conducting tissue and are restricted to much smaller stem lengths."
"1","Polytheistic reconstructionism"
"1","Historically folk religion was often suppressed by religious institutions or totalitarian regimes."
"1","When these regimes weaken or dissolve, often the populace will reinstitute their folk traditions, customs and languages as a form of cultural pride or nationalism."
"-1","In some places where the dominant religion has had a legally enforced monopoly for centuries, the influx of folk religions is viewed as competition."
"1","This is most clearly illustrated by the ongoing discrimination against Greeks who practice their indigenous religion."
"1","Some right-wing European intellectuals, such as Alain de Benoist in France, have called for a restoration of polytheism in opposition to Christianity, which they see as internationally-minded, inclusive, and decadent."
"1","Polytechnic Institute of New York University"
"1","The Polytechnic Anime Society consists of students who enjoy gaming, 'anime', 'manga', and other aspects of both popular culture and Japanese culture."
"1","Besides hosting weekly anime showings and gaming sessions in the university, PAS also hosts and participates in various outside events."
"1","Members can often be found in costume attending conventions and parades."
"1","Average attendance per year is usually around 200, with tournaments, panels, and anime showings running throughout the day."
"1","Polystrate fossil"
"-1","Geologists have recognized innumerable fossil soils (paleosols) throughout the strata containing polystrate fossils at Joggins, Nova Scotia, Yellowstone petrified forests, coal mines of the Black Warrior Basin of Alabama, and many other locations."
"1","The layer immediately underlying coal seams, often called either &quot;seatearth or underclay&quot;, typically either consists of or contains a paleosol."
"1","These paleosols are identified on the basis of the presence of structures and microstructures unique to soils; animal burrows and molds of plant roots of various sizes and types; recognizable soil profile development; and alteration of minerals by soil processes."
"-1","In many cases, these paleosols are virtually identical to modern soils."
"1","Polyspermy"
"1","Electrical polyspermy blocks operate in many animal species, including frogs, clams, and marine worms, but not in the several mammals that have been studied (hamster, rabbit, mouse)."
"1","In species without an electrical block, polyspermy is usually prevented by secretion of materials that establish a mechanical barrier to polyspermy."
"-1","It is thought that electrical blocks evolved in those species where a very fast block to polyspermy is needed, due to the presence of many sperm arriving simultaneously at the egg surface, as occurs in animals such as sea urchins."
"1","In sea urchins, fertilization occurs externally in the ocean, such that hundreds of sperm can encounter the egg within several seconds."
"1","Polyploidy"
"1","Triploidy may be the result of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father)."
"1","Diandry is almost always caused by the fertilization of an egg by two sperm (dispermy)."
"1","Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one meiotic division during oogenesis leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one polar body from the oocyte."
"1","However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases 8.5 weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present."
"1","Polyphosphate-accumulating organisms"
"1","PAOs accomplish this removal of phosphate by accumulating it within their cells as polyphosphate."
"1","PAOs are by no means the only bacteria that can accumulate polyphosphate within their cells and in fact, the production of polyphosphate is a widespread ability among bacteria."
"-1","However, the PAOs have many characteristics that other organisms that accumulate polyphosphate do not have, that make them amenable to use in wastewater treatment."
"1","Most other bacteria cannot consume under these conditions and therefore PAOs gain a selective advantage within the mixed microbial community present in the activated sludge."
"1","Therefore, wastewater treatment plants that operate for enhanced biological phosphorus removal have an anaerobic tank (where there is no nitrate or oxygen present as external electron acceptor) prior to the other tanks to give PAOs preferential access to the simple carbon compounds in the wastewater that is influent to the plant."
"1","Polyphosphate"
"-1","Previously, it was considered either as “molecular fossil” or as only a phosphorus and energy source providing the survival of microorganisms under extreme conditions."
"1","These compounds now known to also have regulatory roles and to occur in representatives of all kingdoms of living organisms, participating in metabolic correction and control on both genetic and enzymatic levels."
"-1","They participate in many regulatory mechanisms occurring in bacteria:"
"-1","They participate in the induction of rpoS, an RNA-polymerase subunit which is responsible for the expression of a large group of genes involved in adjustments to the stationary growth phase and many stressful agents."
"1","The above channels formed by polyphosphate and poly-b-hydroxybutyrate with Ca2+ are involved in the transport processes in a variety of organisms."
"-1","Polyphosphates are present in animal cells, and there are many data on its participation in the regulatory processes during development and cellular proliferation and differentiation-especially in bone tissues and brain."
"1","Polyphenyl ether"
"1","Because of this, this PPE and the other PPEs do not effectively wet metal surfaces."
"-1","This property is useful when migration of a lubricant from one part of the equipment to another part must be avoided, such as in certain electronic devices."
"1","As a result, contamination of other components and equipment, which do not require a lubricant, is avoided."
"1","The devices that benefit from the specialized properties of PPEs include cell phones, printers and a variety of other electronic appliances."
"1","Polyp (medicine)"
"1","They may have a large flat base (sessile) or be attached to the uterus by an elongated pedicle (pedunculated)."
"1","Pedunculated polyps are more common that sessile ones."
"1","They range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters."
"1","Small blood vessels may be present in polyps, particularly large ones."
"1","Polyommatus singalensis"
"1","Race 'singalensis', Felder.—"
"1","Male Upperside: purplish blue with in certain lights a refulgent silvery iridescence, most conspicuous along the costa of the fore wing, fore and hind wings : a very narrow black edging to the terminal margins narrower on the hind wing than on the fore wing, not dilated towards the apex of the latter."
"1","Fore wing: the postdiscal series of abbreviated lines or elongate spots pale brown, very regular, placed almost end to end, the series slightly curved and not closer lo the termen posteriorly than anteriorly."
"1","Hind wing: the markings pale brown, regular but small, the subbasal transverse series of three spots and the subcostal spot in interspace 7 black, the latter not larger than the others."
"1","Both fore and hind wings: with the spots of the subterminal series very small, mere black dots; the inner subterminal series of markings lunular and generally somewhat blurred, the posterior lunules on the fore wing distinctly broadened as in the typical form but not so prominently; finally, the anticiliary black line very slender and clearly defined."
"1","Polyol"
"1","Monomeric polyols such as pentaerythritol, ethylene glycol and glycerin often serve as the starting point for polymeric polyols."
"-1","These materials are often referred to as the &quot;initiators&quot; for the polymeric polyols, but they should not be confused with free radical &quot;initiators&quot; used to promote other polymerization reactions."
"1","The functional group used as the starting point for a polymeric polyol need not be a hydroxyl group; there are a number of important polyols which are built up from amines."
"1","A primary amino group (-NH2) often functions as the starting point for two polymeric chains, especially in the case of polyether polyols."
"1","Polymoog"
"1","Most noticeably, the right-hand control panel is absent, while the left-hand panel is sparsely populated by just a few sliders, thus giving the user much less control over the sounds."
"1","Control over these presets is limited to octave balance, envelope attack, and LFO modulation depth and rate (interestingly, adjustment of these LFO parameters is limited or unavailable on some presets, the factory not wishing the user to make adjustments which would be unrealistic!)."
"1","The lower two octaves may also be split off to play a separate bass tone, with some control over this tone allowed via a dedicated 'bass filter'."
"1","Filter control of the main preset sounds is not user adjustable other than via an external controller."
"1","Polymer"
"1","Laboratory synthetic methods are generally divided into two categories, step-growth polymerization and chain-growth polymerization."
"1","The essential difference between the two is that in chain growth polymerization, monomers are added to the chain one at a time only, whereas in step-growth polymerization chains of monomers may combine with one another directly."
"-1","However, some newer methods such as plasma polymerization do not fit neatly into either category."
"1","Synthetic polymerization reactions may be carried out with or without a catalyst."
"1","Polymer"
"1","A common means of expressing the length of a chain is the degree of polymerization, which quanitifies the number of monomers incorporated into the chain."
"1","As with other molecules, a polymer's size may also be expressed in terms of molecular weight."
"1","Since synthetic polymerization techniques typically yield a polymer product including a range of molecular weights, the weight is often expressed statistically to describe the distribution of chain lengths present in the same."
"1","The ratio of these two values is the polydispersity index, commonly used to express the &quot;width&quot; of the molecular weight distribution."
"1","Polykastro"
"1","A lot of people left the area to live in the mountains."
"1","Many farm workers came from other places of Ottoman empire, in order to work, because many locals refused to work in Ottoman owned farms."
"1","It is remarkable that in the villages Evzoni and Korona, people used to speak a Vlach-Slavic dialect with a great amount of ancient Greek components, called Megleno-Romanian."
"1","Researcher Maria Papageorgiou claims that a lot of plays of ancient Greek tragic poets, not preserved nowadays, were kept verbally, in this dialect, as tales."
"1","Polygraph"
"-1","The idea that lying produces physical side-effects has long been claimed."
"1","In West Africa persons suspected of a crime were made to pass a bird's egg to one another."
"1","If a person broke the egg, then he or she was considered guilty, based on the idea that their nervousness was to blame."
"1","Because salivation was believed to cease at times of emotional anxiety, the person was considered guilty if by the end of that speech the rice was dry."
"1","Polygonal rifling"
"1","Part of the difference may be that most polygonal rifling is produced by hammer forging the barrel around a mandrel containing a reverse impression of the rifling."
"1","Hammer forging machines are tremendously expensive, far out of the reach of custom gunsmiths (unless they buy pre-rifled blanks), and so are generally only used for production barrels by large companies."
"1","First applied to gun barrel rifling in Germany in 1939, hammer forging has remained popular in Europe, but was only later used by gunmakers in the United States."
"1","The hammer forging process produces large amounts of stress in the barrel that must be relieved by careful heat treatment, a process that is less necessary in a traditionally cut or button rifled barrel."
"1","Polygamy"
"1","In Sri Lanka, polyandry was practiced (though not widespread) till recent times."
"1","When the Buddhist texts were translated into Chinese, the concubines of others were added to the list of inappropriate partners."
"1","In Tibet as well, both polygyny and polyandry were commonly practiced."
"1","Having several wives or several husbands was never regarded as having sex with inappropriate partners."
"1","Polyelectrolyte"
"1","Polyelectrolytes which bear both cationic and anionic repeat groups are called 'polyampholytes'."
"1","The competition between the acid-base equilibria of these groups leads to additional complications in their physical behavior."
"1","These polymers usually only dissolve when there is sufficient added salt, which screens the interactions between oppositely charged segments."
"-1","Many proteins are polyampholytes, as some amino acids tend to be acidic while others are basic."
"1","Polydactyl cat"
"1","The true polydactyly - commonly called 'mitten foot', 'mitten cat' or 'thumb cat' condition - is a congenital abnormality, genetically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait of the 'Pd gene' with incomplete penetrance."
"1","This type of polydactyly is not life-threatening and usually not even debilitating to a cat."
"1","However in some cases polydactyly appears to improve the dexterity of the animal."
"1","For example, a common variation with six toes on the front paws, with two opposing digits on each (comparable in use to human thumbs), enables the cat to learn and perform feats of manual dexterity generally not observed in non-polydactyl cats, such as opening latches or catching objects with a single paw."
"1","Polycythemia vera"
"1","Patients with polycythemia vera may often be asymptomatic."
"1","Physical exam findings are non-specific, but may include enlarged liver or spleen, plethora, or gouty nodules."
"1","The diagnosis is often suspected on the basis of laboratory tests."
"1","Common findings include an elevated hemoglobin level or hematocrit, reflecting the increased number of red blood cells; the platelet count or white blood cell count may also be increased."
"1","Polycystic ovary syndrome"
"1","basal body temperatures may be used to confirm ovulation."
"1","Ovulation may also be confirmed by testing for serum progesterone in mid-luteal phase, approximately seven days after ovulation (if ovulation occurred on the average cycle day of fourteen, seven days later would be cycle day 21)."
"1","A mid-luteal phase progesterone test may also be used to diagnose luteal phase defect."
"1","Methods that confirm ovulation may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments to stimulate ovulation."
"1","Polycystic ovary syndrome"
"1","For those who do, anovulation is a common cause."
"1","Ovulation may be predicted by the use of urine tests that detect the preovulatory LH surge, called ovulation predictor kits (OPKs)."
"1","Charting of cervical mucus may also be used to predict ovulation, or certain fertility monitors (those that track urinary hormones or changes in saliva) may be used."
"1","Methods that predict ovulation may be used to time intercourse or insemination appropriately."
"1","Polycystic ovary syndrome"
"1","But in the largest trial to date, comparing clomiphene with metformin, clomiphene alone was the most effective."
"1","In this trial, 626 women were randomized to three groups: metformin alone, clomiphene alone, or both."
"1","The live-birth rates following 6 months of treatment were 7.2% (metformin), 22.5% (clomiphene), and 26.8% (both)."
"1","The major complication of clomiphene was multiple pregnancy, affecting 0%, 6% and 3.1% of women respectively."
"-1","Thus, these were women with significant fertility problems, and the live-birth rates are probably not representative of the typical PCOS woman."
"1","Polychrotidae"
"1","Although the lizards are small, their territories are usually quite big: around three square yards, females' usually smaller."
"1","Their territories often contain a basking area, a shady area, a high lookout, and always a place to hide from predators."
"1","They do not take kindly to other anoles in their territory."
"1","If this does not scare off the intruder, a fight proceeds in which the two anoles bite at each other's necks."
"1","Polychaete"
"1","There is usually a well-developed, if simple, circulatory system."
"-1","The blood vessels themselves are contractile, helping to push the blood along, so most species have no need of a heart."
"1","In a few cases, however, muscular pumps analogous to a heart are found in various parts of the system."
"-1","Conversely, some species have little or no circulatory system at all, transporting oxygen in the coelomic fluid that fills their body cavity."
"1","Polyandry"
"1","Polyandry in primates and other mammals is usually correlated with reduced or reverse sexual dimorphism - females larger than males."
"1","When males of a species are much larger than females, polygyny is usually practiced."
"1","As size difference decreases, or the females are larger than males, a species is more likely to practice monogamy or polyandry."
"1","Human males and females are less dismorphic in body size than other polygynous great apes."
"1","Polyamory"
"1","If marriage is intended, most countries provide for both a religious marriage, and a civil ceremony (sometimes combined)."
"1","While a recent case in the Netherlands was commonly read as demonstrating that the Netherlands permitted multiple-partner civil unions, by Paul Belien, Brussels Journal Online, this belief is mistaken."
"1","The Netherlands' law concerning registered partnerships provides that:#A person may be involved in one only registered partnership with one other person whether of the same or of opposite sex at any one time."
"1","#Persons who enter into a registered partnership may not at the same time be married."
"1","Polyamory"
"1","Another is the image of a parrot, since &quot;Polly&quot; is a common name for these birds."
"1","PolyOz states in its that &quot;The parrot is a common poly &quot;mascot&quot; or symbol."
"1","Punning on 'poly wanna X'&quot;.PolyOz states in its that &quot;The parrot is a common poly &quot;mascot&quot; or symbol."
"1","A 2003 in 'The Guardian' states &quot;Today America has more than 100 poly email lists and support groups."
"1","Polyaenus"
"1","There are no less than five Byzantine abridgments of this work, the most important in the same library of the original, the Laurentian."
"1","This compendium, titled Y?o?????? ?? ??? ??????????? ???????, contains fifty-eight chapters and three hundred fifty-four stratagems and is useful to elucidate and explain many passages of the original, lost or not."
"1","Despite the existence of the abridgements, Polyaenus' treatise was not popular in the Middle Ages."
"1","To this it must be added that only the Y?o?????? derives directly from the original, while the other four versions seem to be summaries of the first."
"1","Poly (methyl methacrylate)"
"1","Acrylic paint essentially consists of PMMA suspended in water; however since PMMA is hydrophobic, a substance with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups needs to be added to facilitate the suspension."
"1","Modern furniture makers, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, seeking to give their products a space age aesthetic, incorporated Lucite and other PMMA products into their designs, especially office chairs."
"-1","Many other products (for example, guitars) are sometimes made with acrylic glass to make the commonly opaque objects translucent."
"1","From approximately the 1960s onward, sculptors and glass artists began using acrylics, especially taking advantage of the material's flexibility, light weight, cost and its capacity to refract and filter light."
"1","Polo wraps"
"1","Polos can be used for a horse who cannot wear boots (for example, a horse may be sensitive to neoprene, or have minor cuts on his leg that would be rubbed if a boot were worn)."
"1","Polo wraps are often chosen for a horse whose legs are blemished with significant scar tissue that would prevent a boot from fitting properly."
"1","Unlike boots, polos conform perfectly to any leg, and may also be used on horses and ponies of any size, depending on the length."
"1","Lastly, polos usually cover a greater area of the leg than boots, and if the groom is experienced, may be customized to provide slightly more protection in one area of the leg."
"1","Polo wraps"
"1","No matter how the wrap is applied, the tension in the wrap should be as uniform as possible across the entire leg."
"1","Uneven pressure may cause damage to tendons."
"1","Additionally, the pressure on one leg should be comparable to the pressure on leg on the other side; otherwise gait abnormalities may result."
"-1","Conventional wisdom holds that because no two people wrap with exactly the same tension, the same person should wrap the right and left legs."
"1","Pollywood"
"-1","Future of the Pashto film industry seems to be bright as there are still some people who want to do something for the betterment of the industry."
"1","In 1999 he made a film, ‘Srre Sttergae’(red eyes) and through this film he proved that still there is a great potential in Pashto films as the story for the first time after many years was quite different and the cast, especially the heroine(s) were new and seemed that after a great hard work the film was completed."
"1","A few months back, another Pashto film, ‘Qalam au Kalashnikov’, written by Faiz Mohammad released."
"-1","The standard was quite good and people liked the movie."
"1","This is to correct the record pertaining the pashto film Kala khazan kala bahar ,its hero was Hmayun qureshi and Not Aman."
"1","Pollution at Morgan's Point (Bermuda)"
"1","Should the oil and fuel escape from their caves, the Ministry of Environment deems it probable that the underground freshwater lens would be contaminated and undrinkable."
"1","The destruction of the two West-End lenses would cut the supplemental pumped supply by 2/5, creating catastrophic water shortages in the summer months, and forcing both severe water conservation programs and investment in another source of fresh water to meet the highly inelastic demand."
"1","The only foreseen alternative is a desalination or reverse osmosis plant, the most efficient of which can provide fresh water at $2000 per acre foot ($1.60/kL)."
"-1","However, when one considers that the price of energy in Bermuda is 6.3 times as high as it is in the USA (a function of Bermuda having no domestic energy source), that there is no natural resource or heavy industry to provide supplemental heat, and that with a population of only 65,000 the plant could not utilize economies of scale, it seems probable that costs could exceed $25,000 per acre foot (7.5 cents per gallon)"
"1","Pollination syndrome"
"1","Pollinators fluctuate in abundance and activity independently of their plants, and any one species may fail to pollinate a plant in a particular year."
"1","Thus a plant may be at an advantage if it attracts several species or types of pollinators, ensuring pollen transfer every year."
"1","Plants do, in many species, have the back-up option of self-pollination, if they are not self-incompatible."
"1","Pollination management"
"1","This may be because of lack of attractiveness of the blossoms, or from trying to pollinate with an alternative when the native pollinator is extinct or rare."
"1","This technique is known as saturation pollination."
"1","In many such cases, various native bees are vastly more efficient at pollination (e.g., with blueberries)."
"1","In a very few cases, it has been possible to develop commercially viable pollination techniques that use the more efficient pollinators, rather than continued reliance on honey bees, as in the management of the alfalfa leafcutter bee."
"1","Polka in the United States of America"
"1","German-American bands resist being termed &quot;polka bands&quot; because they perform not only polkas but also waltzes, schottisches, laendlers, and various other ethnic forms of music."
"-1","This is a contrast to Polish-American and Slovenian-American bands, which generally do not object to the term &quot;polka band&quot; ."
"1","The German-American sound is often described with the term &quot;oom-pa-pa&quot; and is characterized by an emphasis on brass (especially the tuba), accompanied by drums and reed instruments (including the accordion or concertina) ."
"1","He later added more popular music to his band's repertoire, which enabled him to spread the polka throughout America by way of his famous television show ."
"1","Polka Dot Door"
"1","In its mended, yellow and multi-coloured polka-dot muumuu, the creature spoke using various repeated exclamations of its own named accompanied by elaborate gestures."
"1","This was usually followed by a song whose lyrics began &quot;Imagine, imagine, you can imagine Polkaroo...&quot;."
"1","Polkaroo appeared only to the female host while the male host was absent for some reason."
"-1","The absent male host was in fact the actor in the Polkaroo costume, and though some sources have claimed that an uncredited third actor played the role, that was not the case."
"1","Politics of the United Kingdom"
"1","The Government of the United Kingdom contains a number of ministries known mainly, though not exclusively as departments, e.g. Ministry of Defence."
"1","These are politically led by a Government Minister who is often a Secretary of State and member of the Cabinet."
"1","He or she may also be supported by a number of junior Ministers."
"1","In practice, several government departments and Ministers have responsibilities that cover England alone, with devolved bodies having responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, (for example - the Department of Health), or responsibilities that mainly focus on England (such as the Department for Children, Schools and Families)."
"1","Politics of the Republic of China"
"1","Taiwan’s sovereignty belongs to the 23 million people of Taiwan."
"1","Only the 23 million people of Taiwan may decide on the future of Taiwan”."
"1","It is also a common position shared by both the ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan."
"1","A recent opinion poll shows that more than 90% of the people of Taiwan agree with this position.&quot;"
"1","Politics of the People's Republic of China"
"-1","As such, independence groups and many foreign observers are critical of the PRC's ethnic policies, considering reality to be markedly different from the image presented by the PRC."
"1","Before market reforms, many of these were workers, soldiers, and prisoners assigned compulsorily to settle in those regions, carried out by organizations like the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps."
"1","Finally, cadres and professionals have also been enticed with financial incentives, though demographically speaking this category is comparatively insignificant numbering in the thousands the cadres involved are posted for a few years before being replaced and such programs are focused upon the entire impoverished western half of China, not just Xinjiang and Tibet."
"1","Independence groups consider practices such these to be chauvinistic and colonialistic, aimed at homogenising the demographics of non-Han Chinese areas and reducing the possibility that any independence movement could succeed."
"1","Politics of the Netherlands"
"1","Until 1966, Dutch politics were characterised by pillarisation: society was separated in several segments (pillars) which lived separate from each other and there was only contact at the top levels, in government."
"1","These pillars had their own organisations, most importantly the political parties."
"1","There were four pillars, which provided the five most important parties, the socialist Labour Party (Partij van de Arbeid; PvdA), the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie; VVD), the Catholic Catholic People's Party (Katholieke Volkspartij; KVP) and the two conservative-Protestant parties, the Christian Historical Union (Chirstelijk Historische Unie; CHU) and the Anti Revolutionary Party (Anti-Revolutionaire Party; ARP)."
"1","Since no party ever gained an absolute majority, these political parties had to work together in coalition governments."
"1","Politics of Tunisia"
"1","Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, has consistently expressed his opposition to the presence of religious parties in parliament, and the Tunisian constitution clearly forbids the inclusion of religious parties in the political system."
"1","While Tunisia cannot boast the natural resources its neighbors have, standards of living are among the best in the developing world."
"1","This can be evidenced by two compelling economic observations: the level to which Tunisia has become self-sufficient in material goods, and the extent of real estate development in the cities and major towns of the country."
"1","As to the rise of the building and construction industry, a fleeting visit to any of Tunisia's smaller towns (let alone the cities) will confirm that development is rampant: many projects, especially hotels, are newly opened, and many more stand as skeleton buildings, ready to be developed as soon as demand - and capital funds - are available to bring them to completion."
"1","Politics of Sao Tomé and Príncipe"
"1","The president of the republic is elected to a 5-year term by direct universal suffrage and a secret ballot, and may hold up to two consecutive terms."
"1","Candidates are chosen at their party's national conference (or individuals may run independently)."
"1","A presidential candidate must obtain an outright majority of the popular vote in either a first or second round of voting in order to be elected president."
"1","The prime minister is named by the president but must be ratified by the majority party and thus normally comes from a list of its choosing."
"1","Politics of Saint Kitts and Nevis"
"1","The prime minister is appointed from the representatives by the governor general, who has a constitutional duty to select someone who is likely to command the support of the majority of the representatives."
"1","In practice this would normally mean the leader of the majority party or coalition."
"1","The prime minister can be removed from office by the assembly, or by the governor general if he feels that the prime minister no longer enjoys the support of the majority of representatives."
"1","The assembly is elected every five years unless the governor general dissolves it before the end of this period, which he may do on the advice of the prime minister."
"1","Politics of Russia"
"-1","Russia did not declare its independence, and Yeltsin continued to hope that some form of confederation could be established."
"1","In response to calls by the Central Asian and other union republics for admission, another meeting was held in Alma-Ata, on 21 December, to form an expanded CIS."
"1","Russia gained international recognition as the principal successor to the Soviet Union, receiving the Soviet Union's permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and positions in other international and regional organizations."
"-1","The CIS states also agreed that Russia initially would take over Soviet embassies and other properties abroad."
"1","Politics of Queensland"
"1","The new minority government managed to secure itself a majority in a by-election and was dominated overwhelmingly by the always-smiling self confessed &quot;media tart&quot; Peter Beattie."
"1","A major controversy broke in 2001 on the eve of the election, when a number of very prominent Labor Party figures were implicated in rorting internal preselection and party ballots."
"-1","The subsequent Shepardson Commission of Inquiry was widely expected to destroy the government."
"-1","Beattie immediately undertook a purge, taking the opportunity to dispatch several factional enemies, and promised a &quot;cleanskin&quot; approach."
"1","Politics of Noam Chomsky"
"1","Prosecutors cited the following passages as particularly offensive:”In 1984, the Turkish government launched a major war in the Southeast against the Kurdish population."
"1","In fact it's still continuing."
"1","If we look at US military aid to Turkey-which is usually a pretty good index of policy-Turkey was of course a strategic ally so it always had a fairly high level of military aid."
"1","The peak year was 1997."
"1","In fact in the single year 1997, US military aid to Turkey was greater than in the entire period of 1950 to 1983 when there were allegedly Cold War issues."
"1","The end result was pretty awesome: tens of thousands of people killed, two to three million refugees, massive ethnic cleansing with some 3500 villages destroyed-about seven times Kosovo under NATO bombing, and there's nobody bombing in this case, except for the Turkish air forces using planes that Clinton sent to them with the certain knowledge that that's how they would be used.”"
"1","Politics of Noam Chomsky"
"1","Chomsky is deeply critical of what he calls the &quot;corporate state capitalism&quot; that he believes is practiced by the United States and other western states."
"-1","He supports many of Mikhail Bakunin's anarchist (or libertarian socialist) ideas."
"-1","He has said that contrary to what many in America claim, the collapse of the Soviet Union should be regarded as &quot;a small victory for socialism,&quot; not capitalism."
"1","Chomsky was also impressed with socialism as practiced in Vietnam."
"1","In a speech given in Hanoi on April 13, 1970, and broadcast by Radio Hanoi the next day, Chomsky spoke of his &quot;admiration for the people of Vietnam who have been able to defend themselves against the ferocious attack, and at the same time take great strides forward toward the socialist society.&quot;"
"1","Politics of Nepal"
"1","The people's participation was so broad, momentous and pervasive that the king feared being overthrown."
"1","On 21 April 2006, King Gyanendra declared that &quot;power would be returned to the people&quot;."
"-1","This had little effect on the people, who continued to occupy the streets of Kathmandu and other towns, openly defying the daytime curfew."
"1","Finally King Gyanendra announced the reinstatement the House of Representatives, thereby conceding one of the major demands of the SPA, at midnight on 24 April 2006."
"1","Politics of Nepal"
"1","Since the advent of legal party politics after the 1990 Jana Andolan, all three streams have gone through various processes of divisions and mergers."
"1","'Congress': The Nepali Congress is a centrist &quot;socialist&quot; party, comprising of leaders who have worked for restoration of democracy."
"1","CPN(UML) became a major parliamentary force."
"1","Today, in between CPN(UML) and CPN(Maoist) are various smaller communist groups, out of whom five have parliamentary representation."
"1","'Royalists': When multi-party politics began, elements of the previous regime formed the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party."
"1","The RPP became the third force in parliamentary politics during the 1990s, and an important partner in various governing coalitions, it was ridden by divisions."
"1","Politics of Mozambique"
"-1","During most of the civil war the government was unable to exercise effective control outside of urban areas, many of which were cut off from the capital."
"-1","An estimated one million Mozambicans perished during the civil war, 1.7 million took refuge in neighboring states, and several million more were internally displaced."
"1","In the third FRELIMO party congress in 1983, President Samora Machel conceded the failure of socialism and the need for major political and economic reforms."
"-1","His death, along with several advisers, in a suspicious plane crash in 1986 interrupted progress."
"1","Politics of Madagascar"
"1","In December 2001, a presidential election was held in which both major candidates claimed victory."
"1","Marc Ravalomanana contested the results and claimed victory."
"1","A political crisis followed in which Ratsiraka supporters cut major transport routes from the primary port city to the capital city, a stronghold of Ravalomanana support."
"-1","Sporadic violence and considerable economic disruption continued until July 2002 when Ratsiraka and several of his prominent supporters fled to exile in France."
"1","Politics of Khuzestan Province"
"1","Khuzestan has been a focus of criticism by human rights groups."

"-1","He glossed the top of a white metal stool in the same brilliant primary red he applied to the cardboard sheath he made for the radio-phonograph that spilled forth his beloved jazz from well-traveled records, Visitors to this last studio seldom saw more than one or two new canvases, but found, often to their astonishment, that eight large compositions of colored bits of paper he had tacked and re-tacked to the walls in ever-changing relationships constituted together an environment that, paradoxically and simultaneously, was both kinetic and serene, stimulating and restful."
"-1","Tragically, he was there for only a few months: he died of pneumonia in February 1944."
"-1","If she had failed to produce a suitably successful record, this would be her third and last album, most likely ending her singing career."
"-1","Shakira rewrote many of her old songs with new melodies along with her partner Luis F. Ochoa."
"-1","Some of Crowley's marginal glosses and his passus summaries are clearly polemical, but there are very few glosses (and no passus summaries) in the first edition."
"-1","Nothing could exceed the amiability of his private character; so poor a man has rarely been so rich in good actions; he was always ready to receive help from his friends when he was in need, and always forward to help others."
"-1","Van Maldere was educated as a violinist and composer, probably by the directors of the Brussels court chapel, Jean-Joseph Fiocco and Henri-Jacques de Croes."
"-1","His odes, which are very numerous, are also very interesting and in their best shape very perfect compositions."
"-1","In this latter kind he devised some exquisitely melodious rhythms of which, till our own day, the secret died with the 17th century."
"-1","Generally speaking, Ronsard is best in his amatory verse (the long series of sonnets and odes to Cassandre, Pikles, Marie, Genévre, Héléne--Héléne de Surgeres, a later and mainly &quot;literary&quot; love--etc.), and in his descriptions of the country (the famous &quot;'Mignonne allons voir si la rose',&quot; the &quot;'Fontaine Bellerie',&quot; the &quot;'Foret de Gastine',&quot; and so forth), which have an extraordinary grace and freshness."
"-1","He knew well too how to manage the gorgeous adjectives (&quot;'marbrine',&quot; &quot;'cinabrine',&quot; &quot;'ivoirine'&quot; and the like) which were another fancy of the Pléiade, and in his hands they rarely become stiff or cumbrous."
"-1","In any case, prose comedy gained very little ground in popular favor before the time of Moliere."
"-1","Delacourt wrote, “Same-sex marriage has generally been treated like a political &quot;tar baby&quot;' over the past few years, with most parties reluctant to whip up highly sensitive arguments touching on religion and deeply rooted social values."
"-1","Because there were many people upset over Pierce being allowed to remain on the team and keep his scholarship, two petitions totaling over 3,000 signatures were filed protesting the circumstances of the school's handling of the case."
"-1","Magnol's most important contribution to science is without doubt the invention of the concept of plant families, a natural classification, based on combinations of morphological characters, as set out in his 'Prodromus historiae generalis plantarum, in quo familiae plantarum per tabulas disponuntur' (1689) (See under major works)."
"-1","In Magnol's day it was common belief that all species had come into existence by divine creation as set out in the Book of Genesis."
"-1","Nevertheless his work may be regarded as one of the first steps towards the composition of a tree of life."
"-1","Here the last sad chapter of his life opened promptly when he sided with some dissidents who opposed the introduction of new rules at the Accademia di San Luca which subjected non-members to great financial unjustice, and he was unceremoniously expelled."
"-1","The rich Roman art market was effectively closed for him and he had to settle for a few works outside, namely some statues for the Benedictine abbey at Monte Cassino (after the heavy bombing in World War II, only his 'Emperor Henry II' shows a reasonable degree of authenticity after restoration) and, without doubt due to the intervention of Juvarra who was by then architect to the Duke of Savoy, two female saints for the church of S. Cristina in Turin (now in the Cathedral)."
"-1","As popular as the Duhem-Quine thesis may be in the philosophy of science, in reality Pierre Duhem and Willard Van Orman Quine stated very different theses."
"-1","Also Duhem's conception of theoretical group has its limits, since not all concepts are connected to each other logically."
"-1","Highlights from these first period are the Lambert's Church in Veghel and the Catharina's Church in Eindhoven, among others."
"-1","In this second part of his career he built some of his best work."
"-1","Many references credit him with 29 to 33 victories, although these probably include his &quot;ground&quot; kills."
"-1","Recent, more detailed analysis of his combat reports and squadron accounts indicate that his true score was 11 destroyed, with possibly another seven, for a total of 15-18 victories."
"-1","In 2006, Bruneau celebrated his 30 years of work for TVA and received several awards."
"-1","Four major Interstate highways and numerous secondary Interstate routes and US routes serve the region:; Interstate Highways"
"-1","Like I-73, much of the route has yet to be constructed, but several disjointed segments are currently open and signed as either I-74 or &quot;FUTURE I-74&quot;."
"-1","The older, southern segment consists of a former temporary alignment of I-85 that contains some non-freeway portions."
"-1","Essentially, the Piedmont is the remnant of several ancient mountain chains that have since been eroded away."
"-1","Asti comune about 55 kilometres east of Turin in the plain of the Tanaro River and capital of Monferrato one of the most important wine district of the world."
"-1","Alba is the house of Ferrero's chocolate factories and some mechanical industries."
"-1","As these last sightings raised widespread interest, it seems probable after 1948, no pied raven has been seen."
"-1","As such dairying and meat, fruit and vegetable processing and storage are relatively common."
"-1","There is a light industrial park in the town which has several modest manufacturing businesses making goods such as refrigeration products and filtered bottled water."
"-1","There are numerous quarrying operations located nearby which support this and other similar plants."
"-1","The George IV Inn, reputedly constructed in 1839, is considered to be one of the oldest hotel buildings in Australia."
"-1","The barn behind the hotel may date back to 1810 and is possibly the oldest building in Picton - it is used for functions such as birthday and engagement parties."
"-1","They pursue certain things, avoid certain things, and have many different tactics in order to do both of these."
"-1","Spicy pickled eggs, often prepared with jalapeno peppers is very popular in the Upper Peninsula in Michigan; namely in the area around Michigan Technological University in Houghton."
"-1","Today they can be found at almost any bar in the area."
"-1","Cognates of the term appear in other languages and cultures, presumably also derived from the Portuguese word, and it is not controversial or derogatory in these contexts."
"-1","Some of these words may be more directly related to the Portuguese 'pequeno' than to 'pequenino', the source of 'pickaninny'."
"-1","The point being that with each successive leg, as the exotic pick 6 pool sheds tickets, they have several tickets that are still &quot;live&quot; and have a chance of winning the bet or percentage thereof (in some countries e.g. South Africa, punters are allowed to play a percentage of the bet making it cheaper than in the US where a single line is a minimum of $2)."
"-1","Several punters construct these multiple combinations manually and others use pick six software to assist in the process of construction."
"-1","However, a number of proteins require chaperonins for proper folding."
"-1","Thus, 'Pichia' is unable to produce a number of proteins for which the host lacks the appropriate chaperones."
"-1","World Champion Petrosian's sixth place finish was a disappointment, but he may have still been feeling the strain of his recent World Championship match with Spassky, who was eight years his junior."
"-1","Folk songs appearing in the scherzo include &quot;My Old Kentucky Home,&quot; &quot;Sailor's Hornpipe,&quot; &quot;The Campbells are Coming,&quot; &quot;Long, Long Ago,&quot; &quot;Hold the Fort,&quot; and &quot;There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood,&quot; among many others."
"-1","It is perhaps the first major piano work (if not work of any instrumentation) to so thoroughly incorporate a baroque contrapuntal style (the fugue) within an originally Classical structure (the sonata form) (see fourth movement)."
"-1","His involvement had him appearing on a flatbed truck in many parades, which led to his song &quot;Peachtree Parade&quot;."
"-1","From the mid 1950s until the late 1960s, he recorded for several companies, including Columbia, for which he made several records, Checker, for whom he recorded 8 sides with Willie Dixon on bass, and Groove Records,a subsidiary of RCA Victor, producing the first hit for that label."
"-1","On Okeh Records, in 1961, he began using the name Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, releasing several hits, including the much-covered &quot;Doctor Feel-Good&quot;."
"-1","The concerto is probably the least known of all Rachmaninoff's piano concertos, but it is frequently performed in Russia."
"-1","There may be several reasons for this."
"-1","The structure was criticized for being amorphous and difficult to grasp on a single hearing."
"-1","He may have begun this work as early as 1914, according to the April 12 issue of 'Muzyka'."
"-1","He may have also tinkered with sketches in his early years in the United States."
"-1","The expansive first movement is one of Mozart's most symphonic concerto movements."
"-1","The volume alternately ranges about 'mezzopiano' and 'pianissimo', until after several almost revealing seconds of 'forte' the pianist has the music retire into a 'pianissimo' mystery in which it would, it appears, remain immersed indefinitely."
"-1","Over the next eight bars, the piano's motions circle ever higher with hardly a crescendo, then drop for a moment, summoning force."
"-1","The music hardly grows any louder, only to a 'piano', but it is emotionally so intense that it cannot possibly remain there."
"-1","For several bars the volume draws back, then erupts into a powerfully sad 'fortissimo' with heavy, dissonant chords in the piano part."
"-1","It is the soloist who leads to the B flat major slow movement, where the first theme is entrusted to the orchestra, to be capped by the soloist with material of a more rhapsodic kind."
"-1","The piano employs many difficult pianist devices most notably rapid arpeggios."
"-1","Composite forged metal frames were preferred by many European makers until the American system was fully adopted by the early 20th century."
"-1","Among the many Italian aircraft manufacturers, during World War II, the majority (such as Savoia-Marchetti and Caproni) designed and built mixed-construction aircraft, or, in the case of CANT, completely made of wood."
"-1","The Piaggio P.119 was one of the best examples of these projects."
"-1","The '5' series fighters are well known, especially the Fiat G.55 and the Macchi C.205, but there were two other fighters on the same level, the Caproni-Vizzola F.6 and the Piaggio P.119, both of which did not enter production."
"-1","Formulas of this type, now known as Machin-like formulas, were used to set several successive records and remained the best known method for calculating ? well into the age of computers."
"-1","Despite their great similarities in appearance and lifestyle, there are still a number of minor differences that distinguish phytosaurs from true crocodiles."
"-1","It is possible however that phytosaurs had a fleshy palate, as many Mesozoic crocodiles are presumed to have had."
"-1","This adaptation may have developed to allow them to breathe while the rest of the body was submerged."
"-1","There are conflicting studies, and it is unclear if phytoestrogens have any effect on the cause or prevention of cancer in females."
"-1","The generally accepted position on this topic is that phytoestrogens may be beneficial for healthy females and that females with known breast cancer should be aware of potential risks and consider avoiding consumption until more information is available."
"-1","Early sauropodomorphs, including the group traditionally called &quot;prosauropods&quot;, may also have had air sacs."
"-1","One study in 2007 concluded that prosauropods likely had abdominal and cervical air sacs, based on the evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods)."
"-1","The study concluded that it was impossible to determine whether prosauropods had a bird-like flow-through lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present."
"-1","Generally, forms which result from similar histories are characterized by certain similar features, and differences in history result in corresponding differences of form, usually resulting in distinctive features which are obvious to the casual observer, but this is not always the case."
"-1","First, it is possible that the various ships’ deflector shields, when hit with radiation from explosions or blasters, cause the ships themselves to vibrate, producing sound."
"-1","Second, the audio may be synthetically generated by ships’ sensor systems."
"-1","Also relevant is: Many people who are trained as physicists, however, use their skills in other parts of the economy, in particular in engineering, computing, and finance."
"-1","Some physicists take up careers where their knowledge of physics can be combined with further training in other disciplines, such as patent law in industry or private practice."
"-1","In the United States, a majority of those in the private sector with a physics degree work outside physics, astronomy and engineering altogether."
"-1","Modern physical theatre has grown from a variety of origins."
"-1","Mime and theatrical clowning schools such as 'L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq' in Paris have had a big influence on many modern expressions of physical theatre, and practitioners such as Steven Berkoff and John Wright received their initial training at such institutions."
"-1","Contemporary Dance has also had a strong influence on what we regard as physical theatre, partly because most physical theatre requires actors to have a level of physical control and flexibility rarely found in those who do not have some sort of movement background."
"-1","Modern physical theatre also has strong roots in more ancient traditions such as 'Commedia dell'arte' and some suggest links to the ancient Greek theatre, particularly the theatre of Aristophanes."
"-1","This is a weaker claim."
"-1","Indeed, Touretzky and Pomerleau write that if symbols and signals are the same thing, then &quot;[s]ufficiency is a given, unless one is a dualist or some other sort of mystic, because physical symbol systems are Turing-universal.&quot;"
"-1","The widely accepted Church-Turing thesis holds that any Turing-universal system can simulate any conceivable process that can be digitized, given enough time and memory."
"-1","#The &quot;erroneous claim that the [physical symbol system hypothesis] lacks symbol grounding&quot; which is presumed to be a requirement for general intelligent action."
"-1","#The common belief that AI requires non-symbolic processing (that which can be supplied by a connectionist architecture for instance)."
"-1","#The common statement that the brain is simply not a computer and that &quot;computation as it is currently understood, does not provide an appropriate model for intelligence&quot;."
"-1","#And last of all that it is also believed in by some that the brain is essentially mindless, most of what takes place are chemical reactions and that human intelligent behaviour is analogous to the intelligent behaviour displayed for example by ant colonies."
"-1","Since the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 it has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos."
"-1","Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense singularity at the starting time of Friedmann's cosmological model was a mathematical over-idealization, and that the universe was contracting before entering the hot dense state and starting to expand again."
"-1","This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the Big Bang, in which the universe we observe began a finite time ago."
"-1","Common names for this genus and many other related genera in the subfamily Melolonthinae are May beetles, June bugs, and June beetles."
"-1","The most famous Phuthi leader in the historical record was the powerful Chief Moorosi (born in 1795), who died in unclear circumstances on Mount Moorosi (Sotho 'Thaba Moorosi') in 1879, after a protracted nine-month siege by the British, 'Boers' (i.e. Afrikaner) and Basotho forces (including the military participation of the Cape Mounted Riflemen)."
"-1","This siege is often referred to as &quot;Moorosi's Rebellion&quot;."
"-1","The issue that triggered the siege was alleged livestock theft in the Herschel area."
"-1","The Phunk Junkeez were one of many bands to jump on the band wagon in the early 90's that fused a number of different styles in their music, from hardcore punk to trip-hop."
"-1","The band grew large enough to start playing legitimate venues, such as The Electric Ballroom, Club Rio, Mesa Amphitheater, and Compton Terrace, sometimes selling out multiple nights at some of these venues."
"-1","The Phunk Junkeez were a massively popular act in the Valley throughout the early '90s, playing huge, illegal warehouse keggers and routinely drawing more than 1,000 fans into clubs."
"-1","Seeing the writing on the wall Mike Kramer left the band early as the bands guitarist leaving this spot to turn over many many times throughout the years."
"-1","Updates for serial database software can be found on many Internet sites."
"-1","Karaoke clubs can be found in some of the many hotels and customers can either sing to everyone or rent a private room"
"-1","One by one, other methods appeared: among them were manifold writers (used by Mark Twain), copying baths, copying books and roller copiers."
"-1","Among the most significant of them was the Blue process in the early 1870s, which was mainly used to make blueprints of architectural and engineering drawings."
"-1","Stencil duplicators (more commonly known as &quot;Mimeograph machines&quot;) surfaced in 1874, and the Cyclostyle in 1891."
"-1","All were manual; most involved messy fluids and were accident-prone."
"-1","There is some concern by news photographers that the profession of photojournalism as it is known today could change to such a degree that it is unrecognizable as image-capturing technology naturally progresses."
"-1","It is argued that protection of photographs as artistic works is anomalous, in that photography is ultimately a medium of reproduction, rather than creation."
"-1","Secondly, it is argued that the protection of photographs as artistic works leads to bizarre results."
"-1","For example, it is possible that Vogue Magazine would be infringing copyright if they, inspired by a picture taken by a drunk boyfriend of his girlfriend posing provocatively on a motorcycle, attempted to recreate the photograph."
"-1","Similarly, it is possible that a famous wildlife photographer, inspired by a cheap snapshot of cheetah at the zoo, on Flikr, would be infringing copyright if he went exploring the Okovango Delta in search of a cheetah in a similar pose."
"-1","That said, it is possible that the threshold of originality is very low."
"-1","For example, in Walter v Lane, reporters who transcribed a speech were held to be authors of the transcription, and owners of a copyright which subsisted in it."
"-1","In places such as the city of Hermosa Beach in California, commercial photography on both public property and private property is subject to permit regulations and possibly also insurance requirements."
"-1","In addition, if the photography has aspects that may be disruptive to others, such as additional equipment or a significant number of personnel or the use of public areas for more than four hours, it is necessary to obtain a permit."
"-1","Recently, claims for practical methods to improve the stability of ascorbate developers have been made by several experimenters."
"-1","Photoelectrolysis' main attractiveness to many engineers and technologists is its potential to divide water into hydrogen and oxygen."
"-1","Photoelectrolysis is often seen as having the potential to fulfill that need."
"-1","Photobiotin is used in many biology laboratories for patterning proteins, ligands, and other species onto solid substrates."
"-1","UV lasers stimulate photobiotin to attach various surfaces, where scientists can visualize the distribution of the species that they are looking for."
"-1","Using this technique, they were able to bind several species to the surface simultaneously using different frequencies of UV laser light."
"-1","While organizing the show Stieglitz had a disagreement with some of the more conservative members of the Club about which photographers should be included."
"-1","To strengthen his position, Stieglitz rapidly formed an invitation-only group, which he called the Photo-Secession, to give the impression that his views were backed by many other prominent photographers."
"-1","The literary criticisms, generally distinguished by keen and independent judgment, and the excerpts vary considerably in length."
"-1","The numerous biographical notes are probably taken from the work of Hesychius of Miletus."
"-1","Photios continued his career as a writer in the reign of Leo who probably rehabilitated his reputation within the next few years; in his 'Epitaphios' on his brothers, a text probably written in 888, the emperor presents Photios favorably, portraying him as the legitimate archbishop, and the instrument of ultimate unity, an image that jars with his attitude to the patriarch in 886-887."
"-1","Confirmation that Photios was rehabilitated comes upon his death: according to some chronicles his body was permitted to be buried in Constantinople."
"-1","Phosphorus is also an important component in steel production, in the making of phosphor bronze, and in many other related products."
"-1","Sodium tripolyphosphate made from phosphoric acid is used in laundry detergents in some countries, but banned for this use in others."
"-1","Phosphoric acid made from elemental phosphorus is used in food applications such as some soda beverages."
"-1","These common phosphonates are the structure analogues to the well-known aminopolycarboxylates NTA, EDTA, and DTPA."
"-1","Phosphatidylcholines are such a major component of lecithin, that, in some contexts, the terms are sometime used as synonyms."
"-1","Although some lipid-binding proteins are able to insert themselves into membranes and could hypothetically recognise the type of acyl chain or the resulting properties of the membrane, many lipid-binding proteins are cytosolic and localise to the membrane by binding only the headgroups of lipids."
"-1","If this is the case, it suggests that a PA-binding domain must not only be able to bind PA specifically but must also be able to identify those head-groups that are at the correct angle."
"-1","Thus it seems that, though PA and DAG are interconvertible, the different species of lipid can have different biological activities; and this may enable the two lipids to maintain separate signaling pathways."
"-1","They are generally referred to as high energy phosphate, as are the phosphagens in muscle tissue."
"-1","Interestingly, both French and Spanish acquired new initial [h] in mediaval times, but these were later lost in both languages in a &quot;second round&quot; of h-dropping (however it should be noted that some dialects of Spanish re-acquired /h/ from Spanish /x/)."
"-1","It is also known from several Scandinavian dialects, for instance Älvdalsmal and the dialect of Roslagen where it is found already in Runic Swedish."
"-1","Vowels were lengthened before , , , , probably also , , , when not followed by a third consonant or two consonants and two syllables."
"-1","This probably occurred around AD 1000."
"-1","Later on, many of these vowels were shortened again; but evidence from the Ormulum shows that this lengthening was once quite general."
"-1","The term 'gramophone' would generally be taken to refer to a wind-up machine, and from the 1960s onwards the more common term would be 'record player' or 'turntable' as part of a system that also played cassettes and included radio."
"-1","Such a system would be called a 'hi-fi' or 'stereo' (most systems being stereophonic by the mid-1960s).'"
"-1","There are also some interesting tourist attractions in this park like Nu?c Ngang (lit.: Horizontal Spring), a spring runs horizontally instead of vertically as usual; ?á N?m (Crouching Stone), a stone blockading a stream current; Chân Th?t (Chopping Board), a chopping-board-shaped stone."
"-1","But above all, the most spectacular scene is this area is Nu?c Tr?i (Surfacing Stream), a stream surfacing from the ground."
"-1","By 2007, only a few chat line companies remained active."
"-1","In addition to the standard Free Chat lines there are also many popular services that tailor to the Gay Community, the oldest such service is The Gay Connection which started in 1985 in Los Angeles California, and now operates numbers nationwide."
"-1","Certain species of these seemingly benign spiders invade webs of other spiders and eat the host, the eggs or the prey."
"-1","In some cases the spider vibrates the web of other spiders, mimicking the struggle of trapped prey to lure the host of the web closer."
"-1","Pholcids are natural predators of the 'Tegenaria' species, and are known to attack and eat redback spiders and huntsman spiders ."
"-1","There is some controversy as to how best classify the reports on the night in question."
"-1","Some are of the opinion that the differing nature of the eyewitness reports indicates that several unidentified objects were in the area, each of which was its own separate 'event.'"
"-1","Results published in the journal Science after the mission ended reported that chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, sodium potassium, calcium, and possibly sulfate were detected in the samples."
"-1","Gullies, which are common in certain areas of Mars, may have formed from perchlorate melting ice and causing water to erode soil on steep slopes."
"-1","MARDI images had been intended to help pinpoint exactly where the lander has landed, and possibly help find potential science targets."
"-1","MARDI was built by Malin Space Science Systems, and it is the lightest and most efficient camera ever to land on Mars."
"-1","It is also widely accepted that the Phoenicians were very important in the establishment of many ancient dog breeds through the Mediterranean basin."
"-1","Molyvann created landmark buildings such as the Preah Suramarit National Theatre and the Council of Ministers building, other architects helped construct the newly founded Royal Khmer University, the Institute of Foreign Languages and the National Sports Centre."
"-1","These so-called anti-miscegenation laws were enforced in several US states until 1967."
"-1","The story is also used by some Christian Identity groups, naming themselves Phineas Priesthood after Phinehas."
"-1","They also claim that it is a Biblical injunction against interracial couples, transforming a conflict about temptation to idolatry into one about race."
"-1","Pathological (acquired) phimosis has several causes."
"-1","Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (thought to be the same condition as balanitis xerotica obliterans), is regarded as a common (or even the main) cause of pathological phimosis."
"-1","Other causes may include: scarring caused by forcible retraction of the foreskin, and balanitis."
"-1","Some studies found phimosis to be a risk factor for urinary retention and carcinoma of the penis."
"-1","Age is reportedly a factor in non-retractability: according to Huntley 'et al.' the foreskin is reportedly retractable in approximately 50% of cases at 1 year of age, 90% by 3 years of age, and 99% by age 17."
"-1","Because Chaucer's Arcite adopts this identity to become a servant at Theseus' court, it is possible that the 'Midsummer Night's Dream' character is meant to be the same person in a continuation of the story."
"-1","In original performances of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', the actor who played Egeus and the actor who played Philostrate were probably one and the same."
"-1","Howard Furness, editor of several Shakespeare editions, interprets this a little differently, saying that Shakespeare may not have originally intended both roles to be played by the same person, but that directors combined the roles to save money."
"-1","In cases where one actor was playing both roles, Egeus' character would probably have filled both roles in this scene, absorbing Philostrate's lines into his own."
"-1","The design of the programme emanates from the view that to understand social phenomena one must approach them from several complementary disciplinary directions and analytical frameworks."
"-1","In this regard, the study of 'philosophy' is considered important because it both equips students with meta-tools such as the ability to reason rigorously and logically, and facilitates ethical reflection."
"-1","The study of 'politics' is considered necessary because it acquaints students with the authoritative structures that govern society and help solve collective action problems."
"-1","Finally, studying 'economics' is seen as vital in the modern world because political decisions often concern economic matters, and government decisions are often influenced by economic events."
"-1","Still, many researchers have indicated a lack of patience for overly dogmatic proponents of one method or another."
"-1","In recent years sociologists have frequently engaged with figures such as Jacques Derrida and Richard Rorty, just as social philosophy has often met with social theory."
"-1","Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction."
"-1","It is apparent that social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but that they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines."
"-1","Einstein's general relativity as well as the redshift of the light from receding distant galaxies indicate that the entire Universe and possibly space-time itself began about 13.7 billion years ago in the big bang."
"-1","It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold."
"-1","Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics."
"-1","Many of the most interesting problems of modern philosophy of language were anticipated by medieval thinkers."
"-1","One debate that has captured the interest of many philosophers is the debate over the meaning of 'universals'."
"-1","Some have said that the expression stands for some real, abstract universal out in the world called &quot;rocks&quot;."
"-1","Others have said that the word stands for some collection of particular, individual rocks that we happen to put into a common category."
"-1","One of the most topical issues is determining to what extent physics, specifically, quantum mechanics, explains chemical phenomena."
"-1","Can chemistry, in fact, be reduced to physics as has been assumed by many, or are there inexplicable gaps?"
"-1","Some authors have recently suggested that a number of difficulties exist in the reductionist program, notwithstanding our increasing knowledge of the microcosmic realm."
"-1","The noted philosopher of science, Karl Popper, among others, predicted as much."
"-1","Atoms and molecules are often assumed to be the fundamental units of chemical theory, but traditional descriptions of molecular structure and chemical bonding fail to account for the properties of many substances, including metals and metal complexes."
"-1","For example, many rocks exist as mineral complexes composed of multiple ions that do not occur in fixed proportions or spatial relationships to one another."
"-1","Thus advertising is claimed to perform the valuable role of helping people experience a more variegated and interesting life."
"-1","But his stated purpose in these quotations seems to be to achieve the &quot;enlightenment and welfare&quot; of others by way of demonstration and &quot;insurrection&quot; as he defines it."
"-1","Max Stirner was a philosopher whose &quot;name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism.&quot;"
"-1","In 1844, his 'The Ego and Its Own' was published, which is considered to be &quot;a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism.&quot;"
"-1","An incident catches the public's attention and certain types of people &quot;get on the bandwagon&quot;, so to speak."
"-1","It is particularly apparent when the incident appears to be the result of well-known political or religious beliefs, but it can also occur in response to intense media attention."
"-1","However, if the right kind of people begin to believe it was arson, caused by deliberate action, the threat that more arsons will be committed increases drastically."
"-1","'Investigations' was influential in the development of &quot;ordinary language philosophy&quot;, which was promoted by Gilbert Ryle, J.L. Austin, and a few others."
