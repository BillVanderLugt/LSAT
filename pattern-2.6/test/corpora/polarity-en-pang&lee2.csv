"

"

"
"-1","even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .

"
"-1","a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
"

"
"-1","dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
"
"-1","there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .

"
"-1","there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
"
"-1","despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
"
"-1","it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
"
"-1","the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
"
"-1","the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
"
"-1","i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
"
"-1","in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
"
"-1","the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times

"
"-1","rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
"
"-1","not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
"

"
"-1","off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
"
"-1","it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
"
"-1","watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
"

"

"
"-1","will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
"

"

"
"-1","a processed comedy chop suey . 
"
"-1","as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
"
"-1","fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
"
"-1","full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
"
"-1","an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
"
"-1","the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
"
"-1","with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
"
"-1","if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
"
"-1","the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
"
"-1","everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
"
"-1","a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
"

"
"-1","so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . 
"
"-1","even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .

"

"

"

"

"
"-1","it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
"
"-1","miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
"
"-1","despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
"

"
"-1","it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
"
"-1","slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?

"
"-1","the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
"
"-1","scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
"
"-1","while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
"
